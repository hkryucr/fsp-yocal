So I got a small calzone and they got a small pizza and we shared a salad.  I think it was the house salad, so good!  I LOVED the calzone.  The only thing to be careful of is that if you want to have the pizza split with different toppings on the two sides they charge you for one of the pizzas and then for the other side they charge you for each individual topping, which are like $2 each.  So not worth it and they don't make that super clear.  Otherwise our waiter was great and we loved the food!",

They kept the door propped open during the lunch hour and we all wanted to wear our coats. Plus the music was way too loud.\n\nIt didn't improve that much with the food. The husband and I got the classic fried chicken waffle sando. If I was blindfolded I would have just guessed I was eating sauce on crispy bread. Any subtlety of flavor was lost with the sweet chile sauce which overwhelmed everything. I had hoped the slaw could have cut the spicy sweetness (and for the record I can handle spiciness) but there wasn't enough of it.

    "text": "As the name suggests, Souper Market serves a wide variety of soups (and some salads), most are great, some are just average. It's a nice place to get food to go. Just park in the parking lot next door. \n\nThe first time I went here, my chicken paprikash soup and fresh salad were delicious and the service was wonderful. \n\nThe second time I went here, still unfamiliar with the menu, I asked the lady behind the counter for a cheesy bread to go with my soup, since I had received one the first time I came in. She seemed annoyed, and said there was no cheesy bread. There is a grilled cheese on the menu, which someone else working there kindly shared with me, but this grumpy lady was absolutely caught up in semantics and would not let me order a \"cheesy bread\". The other nice lady rung up my order while the grumpy lady angrily rolled her eyes at me, furrowed her non-existent eyebrows, and began preparing my cheesy bread. The cheesy bread was mediocre. I won't order another CHEESY BREAD.\n\nThe third time I went here was the last because of what I witnessed happen between the customer ordering ahead of me and the same grumpy lady behind the counter! I definitely was not going to order another cheesy bread and actually had a little anxiety upon entering the restaurant and seeing the same employee who was so rude to me before. I didn't want to interact with her. The customer in front of me ordered a salad without cheese and sincerely asked for the grumpy lady to leave the cheese off because whoever makes it always puts cheese on it. The grumpy lady said basically \"uhhh no we don't\" and the customer said \"well for me you do.\" So at check out, the customer looks in the bag to see that the grumpy employee purposely put cheese on the salad!! No apologies, just a cold comment of \"Oh, I forgot.\" (Yeah right...) Then she turned her back on the paying customer and walked away, with no attempt to rectify the situation. \n\nSo basically, the food is pretty good most of the time. However, the last time I ordered the soup of the day it was wayyyy too salty and some of the lettuce in my salad still had dirt on it. I can make a better salad any day. In my opinion, this place is overrated. But the primary reason I won't return is this horrible employee who is flat out rude to customers who have sincere questions and concerns. Besides, who wants an angry person preparing their food?",

Northern Belle is a fantastic new location from the bran-trust that brought you Toronto's original best bar, Northwood. \n\nNorthern Belle has a mix of Canadiana / French (not Quebec French, real French) in terms of the decor and cocktails and it's in a great location being so close to Trinity Bellwoods. I can't wait to pick up some cold brew coffees and stroll over to the dog park for a nice sit on the hill. \n\nThey open at 1pm, so go get a nice afternoon coffee, stay for a cocktail, and enjoy a really nice place without tacky wood panelling or pretension.",

This included a dinner, which was roasted game hens, potatoes, and steamed broccoli, with a biscuit. The food was good, however, they gave you no choices. Everything I described is what you will get, regardless of your preferences. At the other place in CA, they at least gave food options. Don't expect any silverware, as everything was either drinkable or finger feeding style. The show was fun, however, it wasn't a full house, which made it hard for the characters to get a roaring crowd, but very entertaining, nonetheless. For me, it's a \"one and done\" experience, unless, I vacation with others who really want to experience it, then I would if the price was right. We used our \"My Vegas Rewards\" and was able to get tickets on a great discount, which made it all worth while, but I'm pretty sure it's not worthy of an $85 ticket. Anyway, fun times, and I can say that we enjoyed the experience.",

When I first made it down to Cleveland and started hearing about how much pride Ohioans had when it came to corned beef, it must be the state meat or something.  So I decided to try it and C & L's was my first.  You could say they stole my CB virginity and I liked it.  I was a fan from that very day and love that stuff, more of the reuben variety but regardless.   \n\nSo I went with the CB and my friend had the veggie sandwich.  She did not particularly like hers because of the 6 ounces of cream cheese they put on this thing.  After some deconstructing and reconstructing, it turned out much better.  I also tried the Matzo ball soup.  I have to say the Matzo was good but not as good as Manhattan Deli's.  The sandwich was really good but since I've traveled to places like Slyman's and Croagh Patricks for CB, my rating for C & L's has slightly dropped.\n\nThe place has huge potential for a lot of foot traffic and did the day I went, very busy.  But I think with places like B-Spot opening up, not sure if Corky's will be my first choice anymore.  I will still recommend it though, so get over there and try it, maybe I just caught them on a bad day.  They have a big menu and lots of offerings.",

The Enchilada appetizer was good, but unfortunately was served at room temperature and was not hot enough.  Since we ordered the appetizer, we went with the small portion of the pasta, and I wish I had chosen the large size because the small portion was as the menu said: small.  There's just no way of knowing portion size.  The PCG pasta was very good and I would order the large size.  The small size is more for elderly people.  Our server listened to our request to put the sun-dried tomatoes on the side and she provided great service.  A different employee who seated us was high on drugs or something because he wanted us to know \"how happy he was feeling.\"  And with his facial expression and demeanor, you could see he was happy in an unusual way.  This didn't bother us as he wasn't our server.  The bread pudding desert definitely made this review go from 3 to 4 stars.  Not only was it very tasty, the portion size was huge, so that made up for the small pasta!  We were definitely wowed by this desert.  We will definitely come back.",

Warehouse stores are a Godsend for making ends meet and getting quality products at a reasonable price.  While you may end up spending a lot of money leaving here, the value you get in buying in bulk can be very good.  \n\nYou do have to pay an annual membership fee, which for us is just $40.  After a few times shopping here the membership fee does pay for itself.  Do some homework, though, and find out if the products you buy most are a deal, as in some cases the prices are not much different than a grocery store.  You can tour the store without paying the membership fee.  Also, produce comes in bulk, so make sure you can use all of the bulk purchase before it goes bad otherwise it will be some serious wasted money.\n\nWhat I find handy is the countless prepared trays and mixes that can be purchased.  Got an office potluck you need to bring a dish for?  No problem!  Just heat and go, with plenty of food to feed a lot of people and at reasonable prices.\n\nI've been a member for nearly 6 years.  Each year I end up getting my money back and then some on my membership costs.  Sams Club is a great way to save money for your family.",

    "text": "As a Vegas local I go to the Palms several times a week. My review today is about the Palms food court (The Eatery). I get slot comps often for food at the Palms, and this usually means grabbing something at the Food Court on my way out the door. The last time I did this will be last for the following reasons. \n\n1. The McDonalds at the Palms makes you pay for any amount above your comp with cash only. No Credit or Debit cards no matter how much the difference is. This sucks if you have just lost all your cash in a machine and are hungry. I am not going to an ATM and pay a $5 fee to get more cash so I can use a $10 comp. \n\n2. After dealing with the above I finally placed an order for less than $10 bucks to use my comp only to see a big cockroach running across the counter as I was getting my drink. The manager in charge at the time seemed shocked that I no longer wanted to eat my food. She acted like cockroaches crawling about was just a normal part of her day. \n\n3. If one establishment in the food court has such a problem with cockroaches then how many others in this part of the hotel do? Is this a problem with the entire hotel? Either way I am not going to use my food comps any more this will more than likely mean I will spend less money playing slots at the palms. \n\nSad that they can't do a better job with pest control or customer service!",

They all had positive attitudes and smiled at every customer. Also, I noticed the owner would go out of his way to speak with and greet every person walking in all the while serving up those super tasty (and customizable) acai bowls. This all combined meant I would now pledge my allegiance to bowl of heaven. Additionally, the location is really convenient and very clean inside. I wish I had more hands so I could give this place four thumbs up!",

Though it served as a luxury it was also an inconvenience especially when we needed to get something from the car.

However, our server Josie was in such a rush and saw us only to seat us and take our order. She even passed us multiple times after we received our meals and still never asked how we were or if we needed anything. I was pointing to what I wanted to eat when ordering and she still suggested something else which gave me the impression that the meal I originally wanted wouldn't be good enough. My husband said that his sandwich that he ordered tasted so bland and plain and wasn't satisfying at all. The only two good things that came out of this was our coffee and the gentleman that was helping us throughout our meal since our server wasn't helping. If I had cash on me I would have tipped him rather than our server. We both are in the restaurant/hospitality industry so we understand the importance of customer service - just wish our server understood that as well.

The carne asada tacos and burritos just come with two things:  carne asada and a tortilla.  From there you can go to the salsa bar and add what you want to taste.\n\nTo get away with this you have to have good carne asada and this place does.  It has a nice balance of spices.  Most places either add too much or too little.  The salsa and pico are fresh.  If you order the rice and beans you can get them inside the burrito if you want.\n\nOne thing that I didn't like:  can sodas.  I tend to drink a lot of fluids when I eat and going through cans kinda sucks.  Other than that it's a place worth checking out.  Really easy access, easy parking, fresh, and cheap (under $10).",

And here's why: The night started with a 35 minute wait in line, while tight shirted MMA wannabes paid the \"VIP\" doorman to let them and their 30 closest friends in before us. We were in line so long that people in front of us bailed and it seemed like every person leaving was yelling to those of us in line about how horrid the scene was inside.\nBut we decided to stay because we had always enjoyed the one in north Scottsdale. Bad idea. \nOnce we finally got up to the doorman, he gave us the \"whatever\" distant stare and held his hand up in a \"I'm holding an ID\" move. No hello, or welcome to sandbar. Then they charged us $5, which would be fine if the girl collecting the cash wasn't also cold and unattentive. \nBut whatever, we're in let's have some fun! Wrong. \nThe bar was busy but not packed, making us pretty angry that we were in line so long. But still we couldn't get a drink. We flagged down 3 different bartenders (who all had the exact same huge upper bodies, tiny legs and spiky hair) until the ONE person there doing their job approached us. It was a small female bartender who was sweating and sprinting around the bar while her male counterparts sat around discussing the merits of the Jersey Shore and spray on tans. \nWe had a drink and walked around. The ambience is dull and unimpressive, the bouncers were all busy talking to girls, the interior has super low celings and tiny booths, the outside looks like you're at a bar in Rocky Point that was half built but opened anyways. \nThe crowd was pretty awful too. Lots of bumping with no \"excuse me\", tons of way too drunk people and very, very poor on the guy to girl ratio. \nAfter a failed attempt to get another drink, we left the bar, confident that not only will we not return to this poorly designed, awfully mismanaged bar, but we will avoid the other sandbars at all times as well. \nSorry to be a downer, I was anticipating a really fun night at a new place, and it ended up just being a complete waste of our time.",

When our table was ready, I sent my parents on their way and tried to flag down a bartender to take care of our tab. The bar was far from full, but both bartenders did that thing where they walk past but carefully avoid eye contact so they don't have to deal with you. The guy knew we were waiting for a table - why so hard to take care of the tab? Then finding my parents was an ordeal. The two girls at the hostess stand were too engrossed in conversation to point me on my way. When I finally joined my parents, my dad said he had specifically told the girl who seated them that I'd be following after I paid the tab. Maybe so much time had passed that they forgot?

I have lived here for thirty years and have come to this place for twenty years, back then it was located near Fiesta Mall.  This is your classic east coast styled seafood restaurant that is family owned and operated.  My all-time favorite dish (when it is in season) is the soft-shell crab.  I love them lightly fried and served as a sandwich, which by the way isn't on the menu but they are great at making special requests.\n\nThe only \"bad\" experience that my wife and I ever had here was when we decided that we just wanted king crab.  By that I mean we wanted a whole crab and no sides.  The server got the no sides part right, but he served us one portion of crab... four legs, no claws.  Another server noticed that we looked a bit confused about what was delivered and she asked if something wasn't right.  We explained that we were expecting eight legs and two claws.  I suspect that they don't normally serve claws when ordering a la carte, but between her and our server they fixed it up for us... giving us exactly what we wanted.  We just didn't want any of the usual sides because we knew we would be stuffed from the crab alone.\n\nA word of warning though, this place gets PACKED in the winter time.  Folks from the east coast know a good seafood restaurant when they see one and the snowbirds flock to this joint.  My sister and her husband once waited two hours to get a seat on a Friday night in the middle of Lent.  She said it was worth the wait.  As for me I prefer to come here on Saturday afternoons that time of year for faster seating.",

I often have to wait around for a route to clear up, or settle for something I'm less inclined to climb. The upside is that the crowding makes this gym more social than others, and the patrons are friendly and always ready to offer advice.\n\nThe music selection will bring you right back to the 90s.\n\nMinus points for the change room. Who thought a unisex change room was a good idea? It can also be really difficult to find a locker. I'm pretty sure the lockers were designed and constructed by a twelve year-old.\n\nBig points for the convenient location, though, which gives it the edge to keep me climbing here.",

That was depressing. I go to an establishment with the word \"egg\" in its name it's only natural to expect to be served exceptional eggs. I myself ordered the huevos rancheros and let me say, they really need to remove anything Mexican from the menu. I felt like I had the biggest slap in the face as soon as I started eating my meal. Aside from the egg yolks being overcooked, they were served on my tortilla. How am I supposed to eat my eggs if my tortilla is underneath all of my food? As for the salsa, it tasted like something you buy in a jar at the supermarket and dip your chips into. And why would you put canned chili beans in my huevos rancheros? Beans don't belong in my eggs let alone chili beans. Oh and the \"sour cream\" that was served with my meal, it was the size of pea. I should have known not to order this dish as soon as the waitress asked me how I wanted my eggs. Huevos rancheros only come with over easy eggs. But hey, at least we were able to have mimosas to help us forget how depressing our breakfast was.",

After an hour wait, my daughter saw Dr. Hall and left the appointment needing 2 prescriptions which were to be filled by 2 special pharmacies which I was told would call me to fill.  Those pharmacies did not call me for 4 days so I spent 6 hours calling the Dr and those pharmacies to get her prescriptions filled.  The real issue is how the staff handles new patients.  They are very rude and feel extremely burdened that you are even bothering them in the first place.\n\nThe first call to the Dr after not hearing anything from any pharmacy, I was told only one pharmacy was handling her prescriptions and that I needed to call them.  I called that pharmacy only to be told, no they were only handling one.  I call back the Dr and instead of being apologetic, the staff was extremely rude.  When asked to spell my daughters name, they didn't like that I was being clear and precise in order to not have to repeat it again since I already had 3 times.  They asked me to hold for over 10 mins while they got the number to the pharmacy and left the phone off the hook while they proceeded to talk in the background about how I was mad when it was actually the lady talking to me that was upset I was bothering her.  Of course I wasn't happy that I had to call back and I had to handle the facilitation of my daughters medication when they told me I would be receiving the calls.\n\nWhoever the lady was that I was talking to really needs to be discharged.  She was more then rude and condescending and when I asked her why she felt the need to talk to me that way, she was defensive and inappropriate and proceeded just hang up on me.  I have never experienced that type of treatment let alone from a medical practice.\n\nI called back again to the main number asking to a message for the doctor to call me and he never called.  \n\nThis office is very busy and there is nothing warm and welcoming about their lobby at all in terms of waiting room and comfort.",

BF ordered the BBBLT (a bacon bacon BLT) - super thick greasy texas toast, 10 pieces of burned bacon, a sliver of tomato and a leaf of lettuce - after a few bites he removed most of the bread and barely touched his fries.

They focus on hand pulled mozzarella and house made sauces and offer pizzas, sandwiches and a range of appetizers and salads, in fact they even offer oysters, not a common site around town.  I had a carnivoro zarcone (~$12)(folded over dough crust with three meats, hand pulled mozzarella and sauce) that was very savory with a nice thin crust.

I eat 1/4 of the steak and the server asked me if somethings wrong with the steak I told him that it tastes like is burned  and also is not cooked the way I want it. (Yes I we paid the full bill, and no i didn't took the steak with me. I only eat the veggies). BTW I visited this place 3 times. 1'st time steak was ok, 2'nd time we dine on the patyo it was in December, The server was very Dirty and Nasty. His mucus dropped in our plate when he put the plate on the table. My wife almost throw up. We just left the restaurant and never came back until I got invited to a B-day and I had to go and ordered the NY Steak.\n NO I will not go there again. \nIF YOU ASK FOR MORE BREAD STICKS ... They will bring you cold ones and broken, not that good like the first ones, so you don't ask for more bread sticks. I never wanted to leave a feedback for this restaurant. But I really didn't enjoy the steak. So I had to leave the feedback. If you like steak, go down the plaza and there is a steak house, You can't go wrong..",

    "text": "Just stopped by this Sonic for a couple of slushes. We were told at the drive-in that all flavors were a \"little more sour then usual\" because they just made a fresh batch. Since we were told they were just a little more sour, we decided to proceed with our order. We got our drinks (Polynesian punch and watermelon), as we pulled away, my husband and I both tasted our drinks. My polynesian punch was so sour it felt like it was burning my tongue and throat. We pulled into a parking spot and my husband took a sip of his. He actually ended up opening his car door and spitting it out. When we went to get a refund, we were told that a credit couldn't be issued to our credit card and instead we could receive two free slushes the next time we can to Sonic. This wasn't an option since we won't be returning to this Sonic (we've had problems with customer service in the past but never the food, until this point.) My husband pointed out that if we weren't issued a credit on our card that we would just call Visa and stop payment. The manager finally agreed to credit our card. We also asked if they had tasted the new mix and no one working had, which mean previous customers had complained about the sour taste to the slush. Instead of fixing the mistake, this Sonic still felt it was appropriate to sell a sub-par beverage to paying customers. As soon as we got home, I contacted corporate to file a formal complaint of this location. \n\nOur drinks tasted like they had made a giant mistake and put the sours mix into the wrong machine. From what I can find online, the base ingredient for any Sonic slush is water and sugar or water and corn syrup....so what in this mix should be so sour that customers and even stand to drink it?\n\nIn the past we have been met with VERY slow service at this sonic and rude employees. The food in the past was ok and it was a convenient quick stop for when we are busy with house project and don't have time to make dinner since it is close to our house. We will no longer be customers at this Sonic location, even if it is convenient.",

The portion size was about four times what you would find at any other restaurant.\n\nBeyond the sushi I also had the dumpling soup.  If you like warm wet dumplings then this soup is for you!  I liked it because it eliminated the amount of time I would have otherwise been dipping dumplings into a sauce or broth.  \n\nFun fact, this restaurant is recognized by PETA.

What a great find!\n\nI was in Vegas for a bachelorette party, where during the weekend, we would be celebrating 2 birthdays (including that of the bachelorette).  So in following with the theme of the weekend, I looked into cupcake places that were doing alcohol infused cupcakes.  After narrowing down my results, to a couple, Sin City Cupcakes became the best option for a few reasons: (1) The Yelp Deal I purchased, (2) Friendliness and flexibility of their staff, (3) Free delivery to hotels on the Strip, and (4) Ability to accommodate to my delivery time.  This last point was actually a HUGE deal!  The other place that I was looking into only had 2 windows for delivery times, and none of them worked with our schedule.\n\nI emailed my ordered a few weeks before our event and gave them my cc info over the phone a week out.  Half of my order was for No Limit Lemon Drop and the other half was for Chocolate Wasted.  I personally only tried Chocolate Wasted and it was REALLY good!  You have no idea that there's any alcohol in the cupcake until a few minutes into it.  You don't taste/smell it, but you definitely can \"feel\" it's effects.\n\nThe two birthday celebrants and the others in our party all really enjoyed the special treats!  I'll definitely go back to Sin City Cupcakes, the next time I am celebrating in Vegas!\n\n(If they had a retail outlet, then I'd probably order at least 1 of each flavor, just to try everything!)",

The facility was guarded with a security office to help direct traffic and open and close the gates. He was very polite and appreciative of us bringing in a few donations.\n\nWe first parked by the food center, a very polite man greeted us asking what he could do for us and looked so happy to see us open the trunk to 10 bags of non perishables. He filled out our receipt, and chatted with us about what they do there and how they make bags of products that will nourish a family of 3-4 for at least 2 days with everything that they need.\n\nI walked over to another area to donate my hygiene and women's products  , a woman took them and expressed such gratitude for the women's care products, she said it's often over looked and couldn't thank me enough for bringing them in. I told her I coupon so much that I get most of these products free, and that I'll continue couponing them and bringing them in more often. As a woman, I could not imagine being homeless, surviving the element and wondering how I'll take care of myself while I have a cycle.  I had a lot of deluxe sample  sizes of body wash,shampoo,razors,lotion etc. As well as some full size blonde shampoos (which I'll no longer need) and I was able to get some bath and body works full size lotions bogo, so I hope whomever gets them gets to feel wonderful for at least a little bit.\n\nI plan to return fairly often with more donations, using my couponing skills to find more things that they need.

Gyudons are considered as \"fast food\" in Japan and you can usually buy them for $3-5 in convenience stores. I guess it is more exotic in Toronto and hence they can justify charging more. Their katsu curry dishes look like they are trying to copy Go Go Curry in NY.",

The only negative was that the steak did have a little gristle in it. I assume the special doesn't get dry aged beef. Both a white and a red wine were provided and were very good. Our glasses were never left empty!\nWe never felt rushed during our meal and wound up having a very enjoyable 2-hour dinner.",

    "text": "I've decided to take the plunge and write my first Yelp review. What better place to start than my favourite downtown restaurant, Solo Sushi Bekkan? I always have a fantastic experience here, but I will outline what happened during my most recent visit, which was yesterday.\n\nI went for lunch with two friends who had never been here before, at 1:00. This is a hit-or-miss time since the restaurant is small with only a few tables, and it could be full. Luckily a table of 4 was leaving just as we got there, because there was only a table for 2 available.\n\nWe ordered water, which ended up being served in frosty glasses straight from the freezer, pre-lemonized and delicious. As for food, I got the lunch special ($8.95, must pay cash) with inari sushi instead of shrimp. One of my friends got the vegetable sushi set ($14.00 and seemed to go over well, especially the inari) and the other got the pork belly (so delicious that when it was done, she ordered a bowl of rice so she could pour the remaining sauce on it), and negima yaki.\n\nThe fish is fresh and succulent and the rice is warm.\n\nThe sushi set and the lunch special came with salad and miso soup. The salad is not your typical sushi combo salad; it has fresh sliced fruit (I think it is apple) and a homemade dressing. \n\nBoth the soy sauce and wasabi are made from scratch, and the sushi chef adjusts the strength of the wasabi to what you order.\n\nA couple of other things to note: you can only use cash or debit, they have had live fish delivered during the day (my boyfriend and I were there during one such delivery, and the fish was flapping against the sides of the styrofoam!), be prepared to spend a little more than the other sushi places in the area if you're going a la carte.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give Solo Sushi Bekkan 5 stars is because I do not want there to be a lineup every time I come. Enjoy this hidden treasure of a restaurant!",

    "text": "Terribly Disappointed! Was told Chompie's was the place to go for authentic Deli.  While the menu had all of the right items, I was so disappointed.  The matzo ball soup (broth specifically) was about the only item that was decent, though the matzo balls themselves were lacking.  I had a Mitch's Brooklyn which was a brisket, corned beef & pastrami combo.  It was missing the swiss cheese, which I specifically requested. The brisket was dry and flavorless (which I suppose I should be thankful for because it could have just been gross altogether), the corned beef was bland and while the pastrami was decent, it wasn't enough to save the sandwich. My sisters broccoli that came w/ her meal was overcooked and the challah bread on my nephews sandwich was a bit stale.  The choc. mouse cake seemed dry but not as dry as our waiter, whom was void of any personality and wasn't very good at his job.  He came to \"check\" on us so long after the food runners brought the food that it was really too late to fix anything.  At best the waiter was an order taker and I think even that is being generous.  I am very glad I don't have to rely on Chompie's for my deli-fix and if it's \"superior to anything in the Bay Area\" as stated in Mitch H.'s review, I feel sorry for Mitch H. because he has no idea what good NY style deli really is.

What's up with those STAR WARS outfits Celo?\n\nSeveral great parking places, either valet at Nordstroms or park under ground for easy access up the escalator-just remember what \"color\" area you parked in.\n\nIf you're hungry they have a food court on the strip side-usual fare, but if you're there then you can stop by Zara's another favorite place to go and find some cute clothes and accessories.  If you park by Nordstrom's and your hungry go to their cafe, OMG delicious salads, sandwiches, soups, kids menu, and a selection of individual pizzas.\n\nAs you walk out of Nordstroms (but not before leaving the shoe and makeup departments tote in hand) go to Aveda and buy some great moisturizer, they give you a nice little cup of tea and even offer free hand massage.\n\nIf you skipped the Nordstrom's Cafe you can go to California Pizza kitchen which is nearby on the first floor next to Johnny Rockets, order my favorite Thai Chicken pizza and a Ceasar Salad, their ice tea is fabulous too.  \n\nIf you're wanting to settle the kids down or just want a quick fix, go to the ABC Store (can you say Aloha) and buy some nibbles there, even little bottles of Champagne, wine, beer, sandwiches, candy, cookies, etc to take back to your room for late night snacking-especially if you're jet-lagged.\n\nDont' forget to stop by some high-end stores for a quick \"you deserve it\" trinket or just to get your bling shined.  Tiffany's is on the second floor across from Louie Vuitton.\n\nSo now you have clothes, shoes, make-up, accessories and some snacks, go see a great show or have a glass of bubbly at the Eiffel Tower just to top off your night!",

With 16 rotating American beer selections on draft and over 400 bottled beers, they offer something for almost everyone. That being said, Bud Light and Miller Light drinkers may complain but that's their own fault for coming to a specialty beer restaurant. \n\nThe servers and managers are very helpful about providing recommendations based on what you like. You can pick out your beer, bring it back to your table, and they'll provide you with the appropriate drinking glass. I absolutely love how they serve the pumpkin beers in pint glasses with a sugar and cinnamon coated rim! \n\nThe food was also good! I had the steak salad served with french fries (pretty hard to mess up) but the steak was tender and cooked perfectly medium rare. The garlic Parmesan wings were delicious, the chili was average, and the pot roast stack was excellent!",

On multiple visits I have witnessed multiple hippa violations (one major being the time they asked me to recite my social security number in front of another patient checking out) on different occasions. Unfortunately for them, because of my profession, I am completely up to date on HIPPA regulations and plan to file an official complaint through the .gov website.  I will never return to this office again nor will I refer. Thought I would branch out and give a public practice a try but never again.

I was told they couldn't do my cake when I needed it, but they offered an earlier day. I thought since they know a lot about cakes that they were giving me good info. Wrong! When I picked up the cake, the name on the cake was spelled wrong; they rewrote the order and misspelled they name. They fixed the name but still looked at me like it was my fault. I was told the cake would be wrapped in bakers wrap, whatever that is. It was just drying out in their refrigerator only to be put in an ill shaped box. Any who, on to the event, a baby shower. Let's start with the only positive about this cake: it looked pretty on the outside. If they would have told me that they were gonna put pretty over a nightmare, I could have at least been prepared for the terror within... So, here's the downside: when we cut into the cake it was hard for one. Two, the fruit inside was yucky. Three, the fondant/icing travesty was thick and appalling. Four, the rice crispy chaos was dry. Then, it crumbled, crashed and burned after that. Straight to the trash it went! I was so sad. After cooling off, I called to talk to the owner about my experience. He made it seem like it was my fault for not keeping the crumbly mess of a cake to bring in for him to see. He went on to tell me that he doesn't know who would tell me that getting a cake early was a good idea. He also said fondant was a pain to deal with (so why do you offer it?). The list goes on... A lot went wrong with my Caked experience. He didn't even offer any solutions; he was never there went I went in to talk to him either. Well, I know that we all have different experiences, but if you choose to patronize Caked make sure you have extinguished all other options and do your research because apparently they are greedy for a buck (it's business, I get it) and I don't know who could possibly do anything right round there!",

    "text": "If there was one place I wanted to try in Pittsburgh, it was Meat & Potatoes. As Pittsburgh's first gastropub, Chef Richard DeShantz knocked it out of the park by featuring a veritable montage of some of my favorite foods. And since the 2011 opening of Meat & Potatoes, he's taken over the Downtown Pittsburgh scene by opening up Butcher & the Rye and Tako, in addition to his bistro, Nine on Nine.\n\nMeat & Potatoes features a bustling, yet cozy space with a central bar as the focal point. The GF and I met up with some friends and grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for our reservation. After waiting an extra 10 or 15 minutes past our time, we were graciously offered a private dining room. But as we were about to head to our table, a perfect table for 4 by the corner opened up so we could enjoy the animated atmosphere.\n\nCameron's Kick [$10]\nChivas Regal 12 year scotch, Irishman whiskey, orgeat, lemon, nutmeg\n\nI started off the night with the Cameron's Kick, which featured smooth Chivas Regal and the kick of Irishman whiskey. The orgeat syrup imparted nice undertones to complement the scotch and in combination with the lemon and nutmeg, this was a surprisingly light and subtly sweet tipple.\n\nFried Pickles [$5]\nSpicy ranch\n\nFor our meal proper, we began with the fried pickles, which were spot on. A pet peeve of mine is when fried pickles come in spear form. Clearly, they're meant to be in chip form. These had a great crunch and a nice brininess that was accented by the spicy ranch.\n\nKobe Corn Dog [$7]\nWasabi aioli, spicy ketchup, radish, sesame seeds\n\nThe kobe corn dog had a nice cornmeal crust that had a sweetness that was balanced by the richness of the beef dog. The light crunch of radish added some levity, with the wasabi aioli providing some spice. The ketchup had just the right amount of kick to provide some brightness to each bite as well.\n\nBraised Pork Belly [$18]\nCarrots, English peas, pork jus, baby turnips, pea tendrils\n\nOn special for the day was the braised pork belly. So obviously, this was a must order and I'm so glad I did. The pork was unctuous, well-braised, and had a nice final crisp to provide some texture. Three huge hunks provided triple the pleasure. But not to be outdone, the English peas and gorgeous carrots had a wonderful sweetness that provided that countervailing element to balance out the heft of the pork belly. The baby turnips provided some starch and additional texture, with the pea tendrils adding an herbaceous element to each bite. This isn't just meat and potatoes people. Pittsburgh can cook!\n\nMeat & Potatoes for Two [$59]\n34 oz ribeye, confit steak fries, mushroom ragu, housemade steak sauce, bone marrow gratin \n\nBut the main reason I was here? Behold the hallmark dish - meat and potatoes for two. A huge 34 ounce long-bone ribeye is featured, though I'm fairly certain there was more than 34 ounces of beef on this particular night. Though I could have used a bit more of a salt-seasoned crust, it was cooked perfectly medium-rare. And more importantly, the beef cut and ate like filet. In fact, I don't remember the last time I had ribeye so tender. This was all topped by a mushroom ragu that provided earthy heft to each bite. The gratin provided wonderful texture to the fatty bits of marrow - easily a cup's worth of God's butter. The confit potatoes were perfect - a light crunch on the outside with creamy tenderness within. Perfect to dip with either the spicy ketchup or the housemade steak sauce. This dish can easily be shared by 4. Safe to say, there were leftovers, even for me.\n\nLobster Mac n Cheese [$16] \nTaleggio, white cheddar, Doritos, truffle\n\nYou don't think I stopped there did you? I had to get the lobster mac, which featured the delicious combo of taleggio, white cheddar, black truffles, and yes, Doritos. The cavatappi was al dente and had great bite. The cheese sauce was a bit soupier than I typically like, but the earthiness of the truffle and the salty of the Doritos definitely came through.\n\nLemon Berry Pie [$7]\n\nAnd since we were celebrating the GF's birthday weekend, we had to end with some dessert. The lemon berry pie was layered in a mason jar. Light, sweet, tart, and tangy, it was the perfect palate cleaner.\n\nIt's safe to say that Meat & Potatoes is a must if you're visiting Pittsburgh. Service was helpful and on top of things, despite it being a busy night as well. Not only are the dishes well-executed and delicious, I also couldn't believe the price point of the meal. It's not to say the meal was cheap and I'm sure there's the element of cost of living when compared to Philly or NYC, but I would have gladly paid more. The next time I'm in town, I know I'll need to check out Butcher & the Rye and Tako. But I know a part of me that will feel the urge to simply return to Meat & Potatoes.",

Turns out if you want to print your photo on a poloroid film its $8.  The $1 stuff your photo is printed on card stock and the images look okay.  I mean its cute for a dollar, but I feel as though cheated from advertising lol :( .\n(minimum to print is 6)\n\nGood thing is this place is open pretty late.  The ambiance and setup is cute.  \nPlus when your photos are done printing they email you or text you so you can pick it up when your ready.\n\nPRO TIP:\nit is faster if you email the photos you want printed to the email given to you with your account.  If you want you can make an account @ home or whatever, email the photos you want printed to that account, login at the fotobar store, access your prints from \"my account\" and boom have it printed.  \n\nI mean yeah its cute and fun place, but it was a let down for me and I'm hoping next time Ill have a better experience.  & give it a more positive review.\n\nHope this review helped.  \n\nOnly giving it two stars tho bc I had the images I wanted printed on a flash drive and it was tough getting it uploaded onto their systems.",

I spend a lot of time in China town so it only makes sense to come here have a couple of drinks then go off for dinner.  I was always a little scared to go in because it has double tinted windows and thought I was going to run into some of the Las Vegas Triads in there.  ;) Nope a cool place with a cool vibe and very nice decor!  Think strip lounge ish off the strip with locals prices.\n\nThere are all kinds of people in the bar Asian decent, Tattoo guys, business men and women, dealers from the casinos like I said a little of everything.  The type of music they play depends on the crowd there at the time.  Quite a few Tv's so you can watch your games.  There is a ton of good food within stumbling, walking and driving distance.  A lot of the food places in china town are 24 hrs as is this bar. They do have Lee's sandwich and Pho Kim Long that deliver food here for them.  I haven't been there late night but I have heard it gets pretty busy.  They have a full bar with gaming, couches with tables for lounging and a back room off the main bar a bit for parties with couches curtains and a VIP feel.\n\nIt is under new management so they do have drawings for four of a kinds and wheel spins for full houses for happy hours.  They have 3 happy hours for the 3 different shifts in this town and I do seem to win here quite a bit!  A big bonus in my book!\n\nSome of the downfalls of this place is because it is such a diverse crowd you never know the environment you will be coming into.  Sometimes they have parties and the music is extra loud.  The free wi-fi is moody and sometimes does not work ( if you now me that is a big gripe of mine ) But I am willing to put up with the downfalls for good drinks with good people.",

The meal started with them bringing us some very light and fluffy bread with their garlic sauce. We then had the foie gras which was pan seared and silky in texture, it was perfect. That was followed by a salad which had a very tasty dressing. We then had the elk chop and the veil chop. Both were to die for and my wife could literally cut her veal chop with her fork. We ended the meal with a peanut butter mouse and chocolate cake and since it was my birthday they brought us some special chocolates that were to die for. \n\nI like to cook at home and I consider myself pretty good at it but occasionally I find a place that completely blows me away and that is exactly what happened at The Fig Tree. It's the little things like the very thoughtful dishes to the flavors that I haven't experienced before that truly make it magical. \n\nI am usually a critic and pick apart my dishes but I have absolutely nothing bad to say. If you are thinking about it, don't. Just go and have they best meal of your life. Yes it is expensive but it was worth every last penny. \n\nSpecial thanks to our server Eddie, he was perfect and made us feel right at home, it wouldn't have been the same without him.",

    "text": "I love this cute little fusion Japanese café. The style reminds me a lot of times in Japan. \n\nI find the menu limited BUT enough for all tasting. The lunch menu is cheaper $8 for pasta, salad and soup of the day or $9 for udon/sandwich. They also have poutine available during lunch hour. However, lunch portion is much smaller (like maybe a bit less then 1/2 of dinner's portion). It may not be enough for someone particularly male who eats a large portion on a daily basis. I find the lunch portion was just right for me. (Very similar to portions that was serve in most restaurants in Japan for lunch menu)\n\nDinner is full portion, which I often need to pack 1/2 to go and save it for the next day. It is of course double the price or $5+ of lunch prices. \n\nReasonable pricing and excellent food quality. \n\nI love the pasta, chewy and flavorful with the sauce. I like all of their sauces; from cream sauce to tomato to wafu sauce. I enjoy the garlic bread that comes on the side with the pasta. The bread was from Bakery Nakamura I assume. The dough was chewy, after toast was crispy. The flour has a hint of sweetness to it. \n\nPoutine was surprisingly good. I am not a fries person, and I don't mind ordering again. I had their nori fries which is wafu dressing with nori (seaweed). Simple yet yummy. Fries were crispy on the outside and soft potato texture inside. Every bite was hot and fresh. Not greasy at all. \n\nDessert is good too, especially when you end your satisfying meal with a piece of cake or crème brulee with a cup of coffee. Typical Japanese café style. :)",

    "text": "I Hired this comapy (even after they  were  late to the consaltation) , on 3/1/2018.\nI told Jesus the owner (and his companion ,  I needed it done by 3/16. For my husbands birthday. \n\n\nHere is what happens briefly. \n\n 1. The workers were late 3x and a NO show on one day .  With NO phone call , no text . I was told by Jesus that he told the workers to call , they never did. \nI was told one reason they were late is because they cannot get to my house by 8 am because the office is 45 min away and they cannot make it that early.  \n\n\n\n 2.The grass they put in , is already dying. \nWhen I asked , Jesus said that happens , when putting grass in , you need to give it time.\n\n\n3. The walkway was done improper,  \nFrom the brick moving as you walk on it , improper spacing (gaps  where there should be none. Sand not put in right.  2  steps are slightly off , and not straight , bricks are crooked and a few chipped.  \nAnd ants are coming through the big gaps. \nThey had to fix it the second time due to brick coming off as we stepped on it. \n3rd time I asked to do it right I  \n was told by Jesus he could not fix it.   Then his worker said it would cost more money , then it was my fault because we were using 2 different kinds of brick.\nAnd if I wanted a inspector to come out and tell me it was done right , he would send one out. \n(I will be getting my own inspector out ) , so I can ge et a refund .\n\n\n4. They made a brick  planter , they said they where done ,1st off the workers did not put stones on each side of my front step  , causing the dirt to go into my front step by the front door , when they came back to fix it ,they just put the 3  stones on top of top soil.   \n\n5. They used top soil instead of potting like I asked.  Top soil will destroy your plants it is like quick sand. They came and took it out , and 2 weeks later still have not replaced soil.\n3rd time asking to fix the brick planter all I got excuse and excuse on WHY the bricks had to be on top of top soil and NOT done like the others .\n\n\n6. They took out my old fence and  bought a picket fence from Home Depot. \nThe pieces they used were cracking and when it was installed , it was put in uneven , to were we had to take it down. \n\n7. ABSOLUTLY no communication.  I had to chase Jesus down and then wait . This last time I texted and had to wait 3 days for a response. \n \nThen when I texted that I was unhappy , and wanted to stop the project because I was tired of the incomplete  job the workers did , and how many times it had to be re done ,and still not being done correct and no communication on when the next step of the project will be ,   he sent his workers to deal with it.  He never even showed up himself..\nAnd no apology for being late , or his workers doing it wrong and having to be asked a 3rd time .\n\n8. The workers left their trash food and cans , as well as all the debris and materials on the left side of my house and never came back to clean up , untill I asked. \n\nThe work was suppose to be done (minus the fence ) due to ordering .. by 3/10 , for my husbands party.\n\nIt is now 3/21 , his party has come and gone and sadly as you read nothing complete or fixed.   \n\nIf I could give this company a ZERO I would.  \n\nRude , incomplete work , half ass job done , no communication and so so many excuses.\n\n\nFYI.   I saved all text messages with Jesus and took photos of the work,  just in case you want to see proof.",

Right off HWY 401 and close to the DVP/404, this Canadian Tire is in pretty location.  With plenty of parking (free parking) and even a number of underground spots (for those rainy days), it's a good choice of locations where Canadian Tires are concerned.  \n\nI went here to buy a 3-tier drying rack for my sister. It was on sale and it was sold out at all the Canadian Tires in our area (the suburbs favor the 3-tier drying racks). I went on my lunch at work. The thing with Canadian Tire that I hate, is that when things are on sale, they are hard to find. They often showcase them in the store, but when you go to the proper section, it's not there.. This is sorta annoying. \n\nAnyway, under a time crunch, we asked the Courtesy/help Desk and they directed us to the exact location.  They were extremely helpful. I picked up one rack and was in and out I would say in less than 5 minutes.  \n\nCanadian Tire has amazing sales, when things are on sale here, they are massively reduced. This drying rack regularly costs $29.99 and was on sale for $11! Pretty good deal. Word of wisdom, check the website for store stock.  They are about as accurate as you're going to get and it'll save you a car ride (and gas) if it's not in stock!",

    "text": "Wetlands Trail is a small trail within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. It is located on North Shore Drive between the Lake Mead Parkway (Nevada Route 564) and Lake Mead Boulevard (Nevada Route 147) Fee Stations ($10). The gravelly parking lot is just off the windy hilly section east of Lake Las Vegas\n\n  The leading Wetlands Trail segment travels on a bluff.  A canyon dominates the landscape. Within the canyon is the rushing waters of the Las Vegas Wash bound for Lake Mead.  A few hundred footsteps further, the Wetlands Trail ascends downhill. The trail surface is loose gravel requiring some \"be in the moment focus.\"  Straight ahead is the rushing water, treated sewage water I might add. Rushing water is rare in the desert. Where else can you see rushing water in the Mojave Desert? The only place I know of is in Desert Wetlands Park on the other side of Lake Las Vegas. Nature has control here. The vegetation has grown to the point that it is impossible to walk the Wetlands Trail to Lake Mead. There is no spellbinding scenery of rushing water feeding into Lake Mead.  On the small segment of scenery overlooking rushing water, quality takes over quantity. The sound of the rushing water and bird chirps with the aroma of the water is just as suitable for a meditation session as hiking. Passing the downhill segment, the trail proper is to the left. A few hundred footsteps further to the left is a canyon. The Wetlands Trail travels uphill through the canyon to the parking lot. \n\n   The Wetlands Trail hike requires some improvisation. On my hike, I went past the canyon turn off a short distance and followed the rocky topography along the Las Vegas Wash. After passing through a cut in the cattails, there is a few hundred feet of shoreline until nature takes over. After the downhill segment, you could walk toward the east border of Lake Las Vegas under the North Shore Bridge. I do warn that the obnoxious graffiti could spoil the scenery.\n\n   The Wetlands Trail displays scenery that is one component of a major ecosystem that is interrupted by a man-made lake. To appreciate the Wetlands Trail, on a cool day, I highly recommend walking along the Wetlands Park segment of the Las Vegas Wash to Lake Las Vegas. You will see that Lake Las Vegas made the Las Vegas Wash a discontinuous natural eco system. The Wetlands Trail is a continuation of the rushing water and natural landscape of Wetlands Park that is interrupted by Lake Las Vegas.\n\n******Did this hike on Saturday, June 2, 2012.",

Beds were cushy, decor was modern, bathrooms are huge, come during the summer to take advantage of pool access or you'll be even more irked about the resort fee.\n\nWould stay here again and will continue to visit for dining and entertainment. That said, I'm looking forward to how the recent ownership change will affect pricing, amenities, and service- perhaps they can staff more than one guy for check-ins after 8PM, there seemed to be a line every single evening!",

It's laid back and the interior of the place gives a vintage-type of feel. It's definitely a nice touch that they use candle lights around the place after a certain time. Just like most bars, the place is most likely packed during the weekends and is VERY dead during the weeknights. Very cheap drinks - like VERY CHEAP compared to the other bars around The Annex. \n\nBut, the cheap drinks sounds exactly what you are getting. I have read in several occasions on BlogTO that the greenroom have been closed due to sanitary issues. Even today, I wonder how they are still open. They leave the fruits for the sangria open all day on the counter - tons of bugs, especially fruit flies, have made themselves home on top of the fruits that is about to go into your pitcher. Everything is pretty much left out in the open. I never tried their food, but I rather opt out of that in case I get sick from their dirty food handling.\n\nA place where I do find myself heading back to since my friends really enjoy hanging out in this atmosphere in large groups.

I recently had my glasses done at another optometrist which I picked up today. I had them adjusted there, but needed them adjusted more. Because my primary optometrist is a bit further away, I dropped into Eye Care @ RR to see if they could adjust my glasses for me. The gentleman happily measured how much more he had to take in, and went into the back to fix them, even though I am not a paying customer.\n\nEye Care @ RR recently renovated their entire office and is now incredibly chic and clean with a beautiful display of optical and sun glasses. The friendly gentleman who helped me adjust my glasses came back with the perfect fit and I got a quote from him for lenses, just for future reference. They came in cheaper than where I had them done at, and offers digital engraving and plenty of other fancy add-ons to your lenses. My only gripe with this office is that I tried to get my lenses done here, but when I had called on a Monday, they were closed and have some pretty obscure hours varying several days a week. However, because it is the closest location to my home with incredible prices, a clean and beautiful office environment, and very very friendly customer service for non-paying customers, I will return soon as a paying customer!",

I also had a half order of the sausages in a bun called chevap. The meat is very tender but not heavily spiced. The mini sausages and the hot, soft bread were yummy!  It's a nice change from meat skewers in pita bread. I'd definitely return for either item and perhaps try some jams or spreads. \n\nI'm not close to this area and we made a special trip to visit this shop. So glad we did! The owners are from Albania and the lady who served us was very helpful. They also sell Romanian groceries and other items from that region. The store also had an assortment of breads from eye, sourdough, pretzels, cheese bites etc. Way to go!!!\n\nDo note they have limited parking spots as they're on 17 Ave and limited seating.

She was so sweet and kind to us. The second, she witnessed my daughter fall and hit her head. She waited and gave us an adequate amount of time to comfort her, and then approached us asking if she was alright and if she needed anything. She offered an ice pack, to go inside to cool off, a soda? Anything to make her feel better. She was very genuine and caring.  She even asked later if she was okay. The third time we left and realized we left a jacket. We came all the way back and asked the front desk if anyone had found one. They said no and that was that.  I decided to go in and look for myself, because I knew it had to be in there somewhere. Then we saw dawn walking by. I quickly asked her, she said no but didn't let it be that. She went above and beyond and offered to walk us around and ask lost and found, look in the theater, and the exhibit where we finally found it. She even gave me a hug! She was such a life saver today and was so appreciated. She's the definition of amazing customer service.",

One of Toronto less known underground walkways. Well to tourists is not as well known. To locals they know and use the path frequently. Great way to get around and stay warm and dry in the bad weather. Also fun to people watch all the fancy dressed financial district employees. I really should wear heels more often..,but then my feet hurt...ah forget it.\n\nSo this Nadege is underground 120 Adelaide in the path. Open until 6pm on weekdays. It has same food options as queen west location, can only assume they bake at queen west and deliver daily for this location. Had my usual almond croissant amazing flavour and texture that I've grown to expect from Nadege. And for a treat I had cup of $5 gourmet got chocolate. Tastes like milk chocolate in a cup. To be honest not quite the same as hot choc at queen west location. This time it was a tad lukewarm and no homemade marshmallow on the side\n\nI like the queen west location better for the seating option and service. But this path location is good if you are in the area. It's just the seating is not as nice, it is the cafeteria outside the shop. And they don't provide dish ware, only takeout packaging.",

I know eggs Benedict can be on the expensive side but the Drake does an amazing version and only charges $14 or so for it. I had the breakfast burrito for $17 and it was mediocre at best. It came with coffee and juice but the juice tasted like it came from a frozen can and the coffee was actually undrinkable (very burnt!). My friend had regular poutine, which came with melted cheese on top vs. cheese curds (they couldn't even get poutine right!) \n\nThe service is what really ruined the experience though. Our server took nearly 15 minutes to clear our plates and give us our bills and then when we had our money out to pay she didn't return for another 10 - so we had to ask another server to take our payment. I guess people come here for the convenient King and Bathurst location and the diner-esque menu, but they'd really be better off eating at the McDonalds down the street.",

    "text": "I will preface this review by stating that I have not been to this restaurant for a few years.  For about a year, I used to travel back and forth between Toronto and Cleveland Heights.  During that time - each and every time - I made sure that Hunan Coventry was the restaurant I had to revisit.  Why?  Overall, it is, quite simply, the best Chinese food restaurant that I have ever had the pleasure of dining at or getting take-out from.\n\nAbout the food:  Perhaps my two favourite dishes for flavour are the Hunan shrimp (shrimp stir-fried with minced onion in a spicy tomato red chili sauce) and the Szechwan eggplant (stir-fried with water chestnuts and carrots in a spicy garlic sauce).  Having said that, others that I have tried and thoroughly enjoyed are the Szechwan string beans, vegetable fried rice, hot & sour soup, and wonton soup.  Furthermore, the amount of shrimp served with the \"shrimp with broccoli (Mandarin),\" has to be seen to be believed (in Toronto, you would certainly never ever get such portions, even in Chinatown).\n\nAs I said, I made it a point to eat at or at least get take-out from Hunan Coventry every time I visited the area.  If I ate in the restaurant, I found the servers to be attentive, but not obtrusive, and the restaurant and washrooms to be very clean.  Also, if I instead chose to have take-out, the young lady at the counter was always pleasant and organized, and my order was always fresh, hot, and accurate.\n\nFurthermore, the owner at the time that I used to visit seemed to always be present and overlooking the establishment in order to make sure that certain standards were met, and that things ran smoothly and to the customer's satisfaction.  Having said that, I have since read that ownership has changed and standards have fallen (I don't know whether this is true or not; but, somehow I doubt it).  So, I cannot really comment on this as I will need to see if that is the case myself.  Certainly, I am more than willing to investigate the next time I am ever in the area.\n\nOn a side note: for those who are visiting Cleveland from out of town, Cleveland Heights is a region outside of the core, and is a very pleasant and relatively safe area with some grand houses and interesting brownstones.  Hunan Coventry is located in this area.\n\nCoventry itself reminds me of The Annex in Toronto, as does Shaker Square (where there's a good repertoire theatre, not unlike The Bloor Cinema).  Meanwhile, University Circle makes for a pleasant stroll, and Little Italy has some wonderful eating establishments as well.\n\nA good time to visit is during Cleveland's Feast of the Assumption, held each year in mid-August in the city's Little Italy neighborhood.  It's a four-day street fair that celebrates the Catholic Day of Assumption (August 15) with rides, great food (awesome Italian meatballs), live music, a procession, and it's lots of fun.\n\nSo, next time your in the area, make sure you go in August, see the celebration above, take in Case Western University's campus grounds and museums, check out The Rock 'N' Roll Hall of Fame, enjoy some of the residential architecture in the area, and be sure to dine at \"Hunan Coventry\" for some awesome Chinese food.",

    "text": "Without a doubt the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to book with. We drove from Tucson Az to Phoenix to catch a 7:40 pm flight. Got alert that the flight was delayed, to 11:30pm. Stood in line for over 2 hours to get over 100 people rebooked on different connecting flights, since by then we had missed the original time in Denver to fly the second leg into Miami. We're told the next flight would be at 10am next morning, or there was an option to take a flight to Orlando where we were assured a shuttle would take us to Miami. My Family in Miami didn't trust that there would be a shuttle, so they proceeded to drive to Orlando (a 5 hour drive) to pick us up. We were sent to the new gate,  where our new departure was supposed to be at 11:50pm. We sat at the gate for over an hour, only to be told our gate was changed. After herding us to a new gate, we were told we were delayed again, to 12:30 am. At 12:30 ,the plane arrives and let its passengers off. Without any warning we are told the entire flight with the original 100+ passengers was just cancelled! On the intercom, they state that everyone needed to go back downstairs and to hurry if they didn't want to be last in the line to rebook, causing a near stampede. My family was now 2hours into a 5 hour drive to pick me up in Orlando and had to turn around and drive home, a 4 hour wasted drive in the middle of the night. The passengers all waited in line until 4am just to be told they wouldn't have a flight til Monday ( I got there on Saturday) my ride from Tucson to Phoenix had already gone home! They had to drive 2 hours back to get me, and I was still in line!  I had informed a representative that I didn't need to be rebooked, I just wanted a refund. They still made me stand in the line of passengers being rebooked and my family had to wait with me for another hour before we could drive back to Tucson, another 2 hour drive, getting there at 6am, dead tired. I cancelled the whole thing and demanded a refund, which according to them I wouldn't get for 5-7 days! No apology, just a $10 food voucher and \"we aren't responsible, it's out of our hands, etc. We were told 3 different stories as to why the flights were ALL cancelled. First it was \"a passenger is ill\", next \"the whole flight crew is ill\" (should have had the chicken :), and finally \"a passenger died\". They come up with excuses for delays and cancellations that allow them to claim non responsibility due to it \" being \"out of their hands\", which seemed to be the stock response when asked what the airline would do to make things right. There were people with babies, elderly people in wheelchairs etc forced to stand in line after line for over 9 hours just to be told \"all flights are cancelled til Monday\" Unbelievable! Oh, and they sent everyone's baggage back, threw them in corners without informing anyone. When you had to go find your bag, you lost your place in line!  The had 4 police officers standing there I guess to keep people from going ballistic. All of the sudden everyone starts getting emails from Frontier offering $200 vouchers, trying not to lose 100+ extremely pissed customers! NEVER AGAIN!",

    "text": "I'm no longer such a fan of Cabelas. Oh, their products are generally high-quality and the Cabela's branded products have given me years of great service under tough usage.  I definitely like their products.  Their customer service however, let me see if I can put this delicately - SUCKS!\n\nHere's why:\n\nI received a gift card for Cabela's.  I looked online for a product I've been shopping for a few months now.  I found a great price, $79.99.  It was exactly what I wanted and at a great price.  So, without further ado, I hopped in Clifford (my big red truck) and sped down the interstate on a road-trip to Cabela's.  There were several other items I was considering purchasing, and I thought this was a great opportunity to get some hands-on shopping.  \n\n45 minutes later, I arrived in the parking lot and found a shady spot for Clifford.  I've been here before, so I knew right where to go to find the things I wanted.  When I got back to the camping gear area, it looked like the day after a huge sale.  Empty shelves, products in disarray, no clerks around to help.  I found the item I was looking for on the floor next to the wall.  There were three of them, and I just grabbed one and starting shopping for other stuff.  I was looking for a propane stove with a high BTU.  There were cookers, smokers, specialty stoves in about four different areas.  The camp stove shelves were mostly empty and only contained three stoves that met my requirements - note, this is not three models, just three stoves.  I finally chased down a clerk and asked where the stoves were.  He replied, not even looking at me, \"did you look over there?  That open area?  that's where our stoves are\".  Well, I had in fact, looked over there, and there were no stoves, just big-assed burners, giant griddles and other plus-sized equipment.  I started to reply, but he had already disappeared.  I looked around some more and finally gave up, found the wife and headed to the register.\n\nOn the way, the wife said she was looking for a rain suit.  We spotted a Cabela's employee and stopped him, politely asking him to point us to the Rain Suits.  \"Rain Suits?  he replied, I have no idea!\"  It was time to give up.  Went to the register and paid for my goods.\n\nLater, after I got home, I reviewed the receipt and found they had charged me $99.99 for the item that was advertised as 79.99.  I called the store, was passed off to \"customer service\" where the phone just rang and rang.  So, I got online with their customer service and oh. my. god.  What a hassle that was.  Yes, now I get it.  They have \"Internet Prices\", \"Online Prices\" (I don't know what the difference is) and \"Store Prices\".  There is no way to tell which is which and what you are paying until you actually have the item in hand.  Trying to get credit for what some might consider \"Bait and Switch\" tactics is a major hassle.  I have two pages of transcripts from the chat session with their customer service, who finally agreed to send me a $20 gift card to make up the difference.\n\nCabela's has just been scratched off my list as an outfitter for me.  There are too many other vendors that are physically closer to me and that provide far better customer service.  Beware if you are price/stock checking on their website as they don't tell you if the price is internet/online/store and you are on your best guess as to which it is.",

We tried three varieties, one of which isn't even on the menu...you see, we were fortunate to be seated at the chef's table (!!!!!!!!!!).  When we asked the chefs (Damon and Tom, chefs extrordinaire) they told us their fave wasn't on the menu - for themselves, they whip up goat cheese, corn and BACON!  Then they favored us with that plus the blue crab, corn and chipotle and the pineapple, jicama, habanero and mint.  The crab and pineapple were really, really good, but the goat cheese and bacon....MMMMWWWAAAAAHHHH!\n\nOh wait!  I forgot about the cucumber margaritas!

    "text": "This store needs to close down. Customer service is no where to be found here. The area has changed so they treat people like crap now. I went to buy food and saw a deal on chicken breast, the ones that they package and season. There wasn't a lot to choose from so I got the chicken breast that were seasoned differently. When I proceeded to check out I was told by the clerk that they all had to be the same. I was confused by her statement as the sticker on all the chicken packages said buy 1 get 2 free of equal or lesser value mix and match. I looked at the cashier and said your sticker says mix and match equal or lesser value. She then tells me they have to be the same type so if it is seasoned Cajun then all Cajun. That made no sense because you then eliminate the mix or match on the sticker and then she said they had to be the same price which eliminates the equal or lesser value because chicken is chicken and pricing has to do with weight. I then went to speak with the manager on duty ( heavy set Caucasian male in a purple shirt working on 1/4/18 around 7pm) and asked him about the deal and what the cashier said to me. He proceeded to tell me she was right. Am I in the twilight zone? Did no one go to school? I shook my head and told him that didn't make sense. I left the store. I've been coming to this store for 7 years and have seen the change in ownership, patrons. and staff. The only department that has sane people is the meat department. It's sad that I would rather drive 10 minutes to Smiths to get better customer service. And if perhaps they stuck the wrong stickers on the packaging at least make it right for the customer and correct the issue. I'm very disappointed and if Albertsons continues to run their business like this then I'm sure the store will close soon.",

The only complaints I have about them are so minor. We had a small flood when the toilet leaked, and they got things taken care of right away. While their communication could use some work, at least they fixed the problem! I had called the emergency line the night before and left a message, since it was 9pm and that's when the emergency line closed. (Which, is pointless to have an emergency line that's not 24-7!) They didn't call me back, but first thing in the morning my husband was woken up by workers at the door, so at least they arrived quickly to address the issue. Any other minor repairs got taken care of quickly as long as I followed up with the maintenance department to push them along. It seems you have to contact (bug) them, they don't go out of their way to communicate back to you. Received my deposit back in full in less than 30 days after we moved out. The move-in and move-out process (walk through) was VERY thorough, documenting any little thing, which I appreciate they pay such close attention!

We had been wanting to try the restaurant for a while and were very optimistic as my husband is definitely a meat eater. We've dined in other Brazilian and Argentina grills (outside Canada) before and really enjoyed them and hoped to recreate this back home.  Unfortunately that wasnt the case. This restaurant may be right for you if you prefer your meat medium-well or well done.  However if you are a rare or medium-rare person, like my husband,  you will find everything overcooked. I prefer my meat medium and i can live with medium-well so I was ok. Beef and bacon wrapped chicken were the best. Sausage was terribly overcooked and inedible.  Lamb also very overcooked and chicken wings were just plain not good. The salad bar was not bad but one of my pet peeves is any salad bar or buffet where the platters are filled with very little food. I always feel like I am choosing from picked-over food. This was the case here -- the plates holding the salad bar food were on the smaller side and were only half full. Sadly it was a turn-off for me. Service was good. Won't be back I'm afraid.",

    "text": "I have been to Park several times, and my experience is always similar. First the good stuff. I've never had a bad meal here, and the cocktails are delicious. My favorite cocktail is the Pillow Talk, which is a light and refreshing vodka drink. The food ranges from classic bar food to yummy salads, so no matter what kind of mood you're in, they have something for your tastes. The ambiance is very cool. This place was definitely designed by hipsters--it's quirky and fun. I'm also a huge sucker for a nice, outdoor space, and Park's patio is adorable, although it is very close to a sewer, so you will frequently get whiffs of an unpleasant smell. \n\nOk, now the reason for only two stars. Despite the food, cocktails, and decor, the service is abysmal. I never go here if I need to be quick because I know that unless I'm the only party in the restaurant, I'm not getting out of here in under an hour. The servers are dismissive and nonresponsive, and I still would've given it three stars, but the last time I was there the service was so bad that it's brought me to Yelp. \n\nWe had a large group, and the first thing that happens when we are seated is our server spills an entire glass of ice water down the back of a member of our party. Instead of apologizing he throws a towel at her and runs away. He never returns to clean up. My friend goes to the bathroom to dry off, and I went to speak with the manager because I just didn't like the way it was handled (no apology, not cleaning up the spill, just handing her a towel and disappearing). The bartenders even told me the waiter ran away and was hiding over it. This should NOT have been this big of a deal. \n\nSo I spoke with the manager, and everything was fine, and she came over to our table when my friend returned and offered to comp my friend's meal and the party's first round of drinks. She also had a conversation with my friend separately where she stated this. However, when the bill came, she decided what was \"fair\" would be to only comp my friend's meal \"because she was the only one that had water spilled on her.\" She then claimed she never told us she would comp a round of drinks for the table despite 5 of us hearing her say it. Additionally, despite the immediate error, the service did not improve. We never saw our waiter after he brought our food.\n\nAgain, none of this would have been this big of a deal had he just apologized and helped clean up, if the manager had not stated she would comp drinks for us and then change her mind, and if we had just gotten some acknowledgment during our meal. I hate being a pain in the ass, but the way they handled themselves made me upset.",

After a fantastic time at Phantom, everyone was down for a nice meal and being right upstairs of the theatre, Bouchon was a natural choice.\n\nTo begin, the staff was oh so attentive.  We were introduced to the maitre-d, the oyster guy and of course our server.\n\nWhile we were walking in we were excited by the food being displayed all around us.  \n\nUs three hungry girlies got the foie gras pate to share, the grand plateau, a huge assortment of seafood, shortribs and lamb.\n\nThe foie gras, what can I say.  Five ounces of pure heaven with crispy crunchy brioche to share.  Sure it was quite pricey, $50 to be exact, but well worth every penny.  The serving was more than enough for the three of us.  \n\nThe seafood was fresh and delicious but very standard.  Next time I wouldn't order just because you can get seafood anywhere.\n\nNow I normally don't like shortrib much, but this was melt in your mouth tender with crunchy bits of parsnip, carrots and god knows what else, probably crack.  The BEST BEST BEST BEST part of the dish was two deep fried morsels on the top.  Deep fried what you ask?  Deep fried BONE MARROW.  OMG.  I thought I had died and gone to foodie heaven.\n\nThe lamb was also very good, tender, juicy, on a bed of white beans I want to say.  \n\nWe couldn't breath after the meal but we finished off with some chocolate Bouchons and a chocolate mousse.\n\nWhat an amazing meal.  I think I need to have dinner here everytime I go to Vegas now.  Slurp!",

Arrived at 5:30pm and had no problem getting a table for six. As we waited for our party to arrive, we ordered drinks & an order of tortilla chips with three sides: guacamole, sikil pak & mezcal chipotle liver pate ($13). I ordered their margarita ($10) which was good, though needed to be a tiny bit sweeter.  The tortilla chips and side dips arrived and the first thing I noticed was that they chips were seasoned. Seasoned very aggressively this in my opinion ruined everything that accompanied them. Couldn`t waste the guacamole, sikil pak and liver pate because all you could taste was the chips. Tasted each dip without a chip. All were good, my favourite being the pate. \n\nOnce the rest of our group arrived we ordered our mains. I ordered the Mexican Street Corn ($8), Swordfish Ceviche ($10), then two tacos: In Cod We Trust and Tostada de Lengua (both $4.75). The corn was awesome, similar to the corn at Grand Electric as well as Café Habana in NY: buttered, and then covered in paprika, parmesan & creamy white sauce. It was awesome.  The over-seasoned tortillas made a second appearance with the ceviche which ruined the dish. All I could taste was the chip seasoning not the great taste of fresh fish with acid and spice. Very disappointing. Taco time: the fish taco was great as usual, the addition of apple slaw is amazing. But the tongue tostada was super unbalanced, way too much heat and not enough mango to counter it. It left my mouth burning well into dessert (and I LOVE SPICY food). \n\nFinished our meal with Paletas, essentially fancy popsicles. Our table ordered a bunch of them; I tried the Key Lime Pie, Peach & Chocolate Peanut Butter with the Key Lime & Chocolate being my favourites. \nService was good, prompt and attentive.  \n\nOverall, our experience was fine. Would I go again...probably not, if I have a hankering for hip hop and Mexican, I`ll go to Grand Electric.",

I'm not sure what's going on over there lately, but I'm very surprised at how quickly the food quality has gone down and how expensive things are over there.   \n\nI recently ordered Fried Mozzarella and the marinara sauce tasted like metal.  I'm not sure if the sauce just wasn't cooked long enough but it shouldn't taste like metal.  I mean i understand canned tomato sauce generally comes in a metal can but your sauce should never taste of the container.  \n\nWe ordered a side of meatballs which use to be some of the best around, and sadly I do not think that anymore.  It was rubbery which is the first sign of a frozen meatball! They use to make their meatballs fresh, maybe they've decided to take a shortcut but it isn't working!\n\nI've ordered Chicken marsala and I am shocked with how expensive it is for 4 SMALL medallion sized chicken pieces.  The veal parmasan sandwich is something left to be desired these days.  Not sure if the quality of veal is lower than it was previously but it sure looked like it was hacked and pounded to the point that it was unrecognizable as veal- and let me tell you for almost $13 - I better be getting a good sandwich!\n\nI'm disappointed at the quality and the lack of attention the restaurant has these days.  It's expensive and just plain doesn't taste good anymore.  I know it's a family owned business and I know that when Mr. Geraci himself was around the restaurant more, none of this use to happen.  Cutting corners won't get you any more profit if you're going to lose your customer base!  I probably won't be going back any time soon!",

With all that being said, I've found that each time we are there the food is only okay and the beer isn't cold enough. Yesterday was exactly the same as the times before. It's an easy place to visit after a movie or shopping, but I don't think I'll be back if I don't have to.",

The decor is nothing special, typical diner look that could use a little love. \n\nDrinks first. I had a Tangy Wishniak (vanilla ice cream, ginger ale and grenadine). It sounds weird but it was REALLY good. My sister had a $3 mimosa which was a decent size for three bucks. And my fiancé had one of their many craft beers. \n\nThe food however, I was expecting more from it. I had the fromage a trois (a grilled cheese) that was delicious but I was expecting a much larger portion from a diner. My fiancé had pancakes which were HUGE and they looked delicious. However you had to order extra syrup with a $2.50 charge. Finally my sister had a burger with coney fries. The burger was a decent size, but the fries weren't a sizeable portion. The taste of everything however was pretty delicious. \n\nAll in all it was an okay experience. The servers were more focused on their friends and each other but were nice.",

IMO, Gordon Biersch is on that list. \nSome people hate page long menus like this one or the Cheesecake Factory. Not me, I LOVE choices. Although that usually means ordering more than I need or can intake but I am totally ok with that! \nBetween the options of soup, salad, steak, seafood, pasta, and even the occasional  Hispanic or Asian flare- you can pretty much please everyone. I am not saying every single dish is off the charts, but I haven't had anything I wouldn't order again. \nA couple favorites are the Pecan Crusted chicken, Cajun fish tacos, the plain ol house salad (with extra dressing), salmon, and a friend of mine swears by the Cajun pasta, but I have yet to try it.\nAnother plus- convenience!!!\nI can come here to sit at the bar, have a family dinner, or be in and out within my hour lunch break. Truly a great location in the central business are of Vegas. \nOverall, there are FEW chains I would ever recommend, and this will always be one of them!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Village Ice Cream's shop for a couple months now. I can never say no to good local, artisan ice cream and these guys/girls know what they're doing. I had a nice chat with the girl working the front and they do everything as local and organic as possible. Ingredients, supplies, you name it, they use 'em.\n\nVillage Ice Cream is tucked away in a slightly random, industrial warehouse area. You won't see it from the street but just keep on going and you'll be rewarded for your efforts. The perfect spot for summer and hanging out, look at those cute benches out front. Lucky for me, there was no line when I went (score!) but don't let the pictures and snow deceive you. It was waaaaarm for a Friday (winter) afternoon.\n\nLook at all the flavours to choose from. I like how there are 10 staple flavours and then 3 seasonal flavours to choose from. Nice and simple. The seasonal ones were cereal milk crunch, melted chocolate and snicker doodle. I had a sample of the cereal and it tasted exactly as described. I decided to keep it simple for my first taste of Village's Ice Cream and based on the girl's recommendations, I went with vanilla bean and early grey.\n\n- Village vanilla bean and earl grey ($7.00 double scoop) and handmade waffle cone ($1.00) - out of the two flavours, the vanilla bean (top) was my favourite. It was rich, creamy and did the classic justice. Doing simple things well is always hard to do so props to Village. The earl grey (bottom) was good but for me, I felt it needed a stronger tea flavour to it. A little too subtle/mild for my tastes.\nLet's talk a bit on that homemade waffle cone - crispy, thin and fresh. That's a winning combo. Homemade is just better. Yes to human labour, all day, err day.\n\nDefinitely a great spot to take a date or friends for some ice cream deliciousness. Oh man, can't wait for my next visit to try some more flavours!",

    "text": "We made reservations as we have never dined here.  We went on a Saturday @ 615, and were going to a movie next door after. We decided on mussels, a brie and apple plate and salads. Well what a disappointment. The mussels were not only fishy but had an odor. When my husband told the waiter they were fishy she took them away and didn't mention anything of it. The 9.00 Apple & Brie plate was such a disappointment. It literally came out with 5 small slices of apple, an extremely light spread of apple butter and  about a \"pea size\" of brie. It was nothing like we ever had, which is fine. It was just so skimpy for the price. Nice idea, but if it wasnt for the name of the appetizer \"apple and brie\" we would have never known it was brie that was smeared across the tip of the apple. We also got 2 of the mixed green salads, and once again couldnt even taste the vinegarette it was tossed in. We do not like heavy dressings and prefer the lighter style of majority of the food we eat, but I must say they need to tweak things in their kitchen a bit. It's not coming together as it should. We love to try new places and love tapas and small plate diners, but I think this would be a wine/beer stop only for us.",

I am in a long, drawn out love affair with their salted caramel brownies - like everyone else in charlotte. \n\nThe food is ok. I'm currently crunching on a turkey and brie sandwich... but it's just ok. Even the caramel brownie isn't out of this world like I have experienced at the other location. Just something off.\n\nThis location is more open and easier to navigate. There's a place for a line to form, plenty of seating, and an outdoor patio where the Love Locks live. It's all nice, but there's nothing fancy or \"hidden gem\" about this place. This isnt the quiet study spot that i expected it to be, but maybe I'm comparing it too much to NoDa? The staff doesn't help much either. I've been here 3 or 4 times and every time I feel like I'm not hip enough - and Lord knows, it could just be me. Haha. When I order at the counter, I feel like I'm interrupting something, or not doing it right. There's not a whole lot of explanation - more \"what do you want?\". Nah mean?\n\nSo, I'll continue eating my sandwich and floating on their wifi. I'm not in love with this location like I thought I would be. I think if I didn't know what to expect, and had never heard of Amelie's, it might bring in another star - but only for the unique decorating. \n\nIt's fine, and I'll come here again for coffee... *womp womp*",

You are allowed to ask questions, and they don't just give you answers, they are still in character and give you a strong clue. Don't be afraid to ask questions, that was our teams weakness. \nWe had so much fun, and talked about it and compared notes for the rest of the night. We are planning on going back and try all the missions. I think it would be a great double date. \nHalloween is coming up, and they told me they are planning some fun stuff, I can't wait!",

Usually the lineup is out the door and down the street but fortunately the whole neighborhood was at a street festival and this place wasn't busy so I took advantage. In a sea of trendy gelato places and soulless frozen yogurt joints - Dutch Dreams is every child's ultimate fantasy. Imagine you are 8 years old and you've just won the Hunger Games and your prize is \"anything in the world you want\" and one of your requests is the most decadent, childlike, fun and cartoony ice cream parlor you can imagine. This is that place. Dutch Dreams is how I imagine the candy house in the woods from Hansel and Gretel to look like.\n\nAnyways, it's basically the absolute best ice cream parlor in Toronto and anywhere else for that matter.\n\nToday I ordered a simple cone with half chocolate fudge and half watermelon ice cream. They never fail to top their cones with an abundance of berries, pineapple, kiwi, whipped cream, chocolate sauce and a waffle cone piece.\n\nIt's safer and less messy to get your ice cream in a cup but even with the cones, they manage to secure all the toppings in place. \n\nAnd remember - this isn't just a summer indulgence. There's nothing cozier than hiding out in their charming indoor seating area on a snowy winter's day and chowing down on their ice cream and hot fudge brownie monstrosity!",

I was annoyed and wanted a glass of wine or cocktail, but didn't want to go to a casino or anywhere with a crowd of tourists.  So I decided to go somewhere the locals would go, and thanks to Yelp, I found this place.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  I love the tall ~vaulted 30ft floor-to-ceiling with the modern yet vintage-like light fixtures, and the dark wood and inviting bar.  \n\nOur waiter was super friendly and extremely attentive. My choice of wine was great, but i had to kick it up a notch due to my veins boiling from the involuntary choice of taking a red-eye flight back home.  I have to say their expresso martinis are excellent.  We had just appetizers: the Hamachi, calamari, crab cakes, mac and cheese, and arugula salad.  The food was good but really nothing spectacular.  Roger Federer was playing and on the other HDTVs the Dodgers were beating the Padres... don't know who actually won on either... I was enjoying my expresso martini and my conversation with my parents.  I will definitely come back when I visit them again... the expresso martinis were perfect... not creamy or sweet, but exactly how it should taste.  I loved it.",

    "text": "I'm willing to give this place a second chance.  There is a lot of potential with this snazzy, rustic bar/resto.  The reason I am giving Park on Fremont three stars is because of the service and SUPER LOUD MUSIC in the garden.  \n\n8:30pm Friday night - When we got to the restaurant, I told the hostess we needed a table for two.  She started guiding us to a table outside facing Fremont Street, so I asked her if there was a table available in the back garden.  She told us that if we wanted to take a seat in the front, she would come get us once a table was ready in the garden.  \n\nTwenty minutes went by, and the hostess (girl with long/straight/two toned hair), was nowhere to be found.  Seems as though she went on break and forgot about us.  After my guest and I were done with our first round of drinks, I decided to go up to the new hostess to ask if a table was available for us in the back.  The new hostess apologized that her coworker had forgotten about us, and then walked us into the back garden, where there were several open seats - why we weren't given a seat in the garden initially is a mystery to me.  \n\nThe garden was exactly what I imagined it to be.  I wouldn't recommend taking older folks here, since the music is LOUD and some of the chairs are slightly uncomfortable.  \n\nI wish they had more apps on the menu.  It would be nice to order a few sides, rather than a large meal.  They have fries, etc, but nothing healthy.  I ended up ordering the veggie sliders - which were delicious.  The buns were stale, but the veggie patty itself, was delicious!  My guest had the corn flake crusted chicken and he LOVED IT!\n\nThroughout the meal, our waitress was missing, a lot.  Our drinks were empty most of the time, and I even noticed the table next to us making loud slurping noises from their glasses (probably hoping to get the attention of a waiter).  The outside bar had a group of employees hanging around talking most of the time, so the issue wasn't understaffing.  \n\nI hope management reads these reviews, because I really want to like this place.  I am hoping it was just a bad night.  I'll be back soon to try it again, but if the service is still sloppy and careless, I won't be back.  I used to be a concierge at a major strip property, and I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending this place yet to anyone (until they work our these small, but large, kinks).  I hope I can come back here at a later time and update my review with more stars - like I said, I really want to like this place.  \n\nI LOVE Commonwealth, and know it's owned by the same creators, but I don't feel like it's exactly up to par with it yet.",

Our meal also came with 2 complimentary oysters which were delicious. More so 'cause they were free. But this was a grand opening special so not sure if they still have it. \n\nI felt my kalbi tang was ok. It was good, but nothing to write home about. The sushi my bf got was really fresh, but he had the unfortunate incident of getting piece with extra wasabi. Service wise everything was quite good and attentive. Our server made sure she let us know about any possible special we might've been interested in, which was nice. \n\nOverall, it's more like a 3.5 for food quality, but with the amount of free food you get with your meal (excluding oysters, you still get the egg pudding and 5 banchans), I was able to leave super satisfied and felt like we got our money's worth.

We recently purchased some sofas and a sectional from the Room Store.  As soon as they were delivered we knew there was trouble with the back cushions.  They didn't have the proper fill/support in them.  They sent someone out twice who just stuffed more hollow fill into the cushions, which only served to make the cushions stick way out into he seat cushion part.  Very annoying.  We didn't want to return the sofas because we had waited so long for the custom pieces and liked the overall look and fabric we were able to select.\n\nI called Rick at Sit-Well after reading the reviews and was pleasantly surprised at how polite the folks there are.  When Ed and Johnny came out to pick up the furniture to take it back to the shop and replace the hollow fill with solid foam and Dacron layers, they were professional and very polite.  Ed and Johnny did FANTASTIC work, brought it back the same day, and the furniture looks better than it ever did.  Now the fabric won't wear out prematurely from being over stressed!\n\nI cannot say enough about how impressed I am to find a business that still cares about service, quality, and their customers.  I give them an A+!",

You don't have to order something and then eat it while standing on the sidewalk or while wandering around. I was surprised at how spacious the place is, given how small many neighbouring places are.\n\nThe place is clean, the service is quick (waited about 10 minutes after ordering while 6-8 people waited ahead of me), the staff is friendly and they were pretty quick to clean the tables after people left.\n\nFor a little over $12 with tax, I got \"The Works\" burger (lettuce, tomato, sauteed mushrooms, caramelized onions, bacon, chese \"GBC\" sauce) with onion rings and a can of pop. A good price compared with other places.\n\nThe burger was fresh and juicy and cooked just right. The onion rings (about 10-12 in total) were light and crispy - not overcooked and crunchy. According to the menu, they're beer battered.\n\nI was happy with the burger, the price and the seating capacity - GBC has been added to my list of regular lunch spots.",

    "text": "For those who follow my reviews, many will notice that I rarely write any scathing reviews. And to be fair my experience here prior to ordering my bridesmaid dress was not bad at all. When picking my dress the young ladies that helped me and my friends were polite and helpful. We decided to order from here because there's a deal where with 5 dress orders you can either get 10%off or alterations will only cost $25. There was actually some misunderstanding here at first because I thought they meant that if I needed alterations and it didn't amount to over $25 they would do it for free, but apparently I misunderstood. This is fine. I can let it go. \n\nSo I've booked my 2nd fitting and during my booking the lady told me everything would be ready for Nov 1. Since the wedding is a few weeks from that date and I no longer frequent this area I asked her what if more worked needed to be done following that date. The lady confidently assured me that everything is usually fine and I can just try it on and go. \n\nFast forward to Nov 1, I tried on my dress, it fit and the same lady was ready to steam my dress for me. Then I noticed that parts of the dress was actually unfinished, open seams and everything. Then she quickly told Joanna to go back in to the back room to finish it up and I can walk around a bit and pick it up. Here I was already mildly irritated but it wasn't a big issue. THEN she tells me that more work needs to be done and that I should return in a couple of hours.\n\nAt this point, I pointed out to her that she promised me the dress would be ready and good to go on this day, and I relied on that. Then she begins to shift the blame and I told her, if you knew it was unfinished then you could have called me and told me so. Then she returned to the sewing room returned and asserted that this was \"a second fitting and expressly wrote it down\" so it is expected that there should be more work done. \n\nAll I really wanted was for her to apologize for causing me the extra inconvenience of having to return at another time because they, as a business, failed to complete their work within the promised time frame. Not only did I not receive such an apology but this lady had the audacity to tell me that as a second fitting this was too be expected. This all could have been avoided if the lady I interacted with was upfront and told me more time is necessary after I go for the 2nd fitting to complete the dress. Not only did she fail to do this, but she wasted my time by promising me the exact opposite of that then goes along and retracts that statement. I will not waste any more of my energy on being irritated by this establishment BUT I will make it a point never to give them my business again and I will discourage any friends from purchasing anything from here as well.\n\nThe two stars are for the lovely younger staff at the business. In my opinion they did their job well and perhaps the store should rely on them in the future for any further customer interaction.",

They're literally right across the parking lot from each other, they offer somewhat similar menus, and I thought I heard that the owners were related.  But they also seem different.\n\nMy son and I have tried Villa's twice now, having taken my wife on the last visit, and have tried the following:\n\nBeans (in burrito and as a side) -- decent beans and cheese, as well as a tasty red salsa on the side that goes well with them.\n\nChips -- freshly fried tortilla chips are the best and for some reason rare in these smaller Mexican restaurants.  Villa's has them.\n\nGuacamole -- quite good, actually; a nice balance of the lime, cilantro, onions/garlic in a creamy avocado base.  Highly recommended.\n\nChicken Burrito -- also quite good.  My wife thinks this one definitely beats the place across the parking lot.  I think I agree.\n\nCarnitas Burrito -- This is what I ordered on my last visit, and I thought it was excellent.  The pork tasted like it had been slow roasted, a little dry and fatty, but just about right.  And the tortilla, as always, is quite tasty.\n\nVilla's, though, needs a little help with the ambience.  The walls are mostly bare and the sun comes glaring straight through the windows at dinner time.  Only half of each plastic bench/table combo is actually functional when trying to avoid the harsh sunlight.\n\nOtherwise, I'd say that the owners have done a great job in this tiny little space.  But seriously, this is the second Mexican food place to open in Laveen and not offer cervezas on the menu.  I hope the next one to open (I'm sure there will be more) sees this opportunity.\n\nOne more note: I did not appreciate being bombarded on Yelp by the owner's messages announcing that Villa's was opening soon.  Also, my first attempt to visit -- after receiving a coupon on my Fry's receipt -- was a failure, as they hadn't yet opened.  Perhaps the owners could work a little harder on future marketing efforts.",

Lettuce and tomato well portioned, did not overwhelm the overall taste. The meat was well marinated, perfectly cooked, and extremely filling. Bun lost its points but the china presentation made up for it. So far best traditional style burger we've tasted, but not better than the maple burger (review about that to come).

Why would you over schedule services and or only have one shuttle running when you clearly need more.   I use to recommend everyone to this dealership but looks like I will be taking my business elsewhere, even if I have to pay more. My time is clearly not valuable to them.",

I highly suggest it.) but also because of the retro vibe that comes from the theater itself. \n\nIt was very clearly designed in the 70's or 80's, and the entirety of the building reflects that. But in the same way, it is beautiful, small, and personal.\n\nThere is no better way to see an independent film in Phoenix than at this intimate theater.\n\n(They're also really chill about outside food and drinks.

We were promised same day delivery and did not get our appliances until the following evening at 8pm - after two days of arguing with them on the phone. The only reason we bought from this place is so we could get them in ASAP and they guaranteed we would.  The second we gave them CASH (which they demanded) their tune changed.  When the appliances were finally delivered two days later, the fridge was in very gross condition and totally stopped working the next day. I woke up and opened my fridge to find everything was warm and spoiled.  When I called to talk to someone about it, I was told I need to speak to the owner, and the owner does not answer the phone or return voicemails.  I don't know how this place is in business??  Luckily, I purchased a home warranty and had a legitimate company come out to fix my fridge.  They had to install a 250.00 part to get it working.  If I didn't have my home warranty, it would have been a mess.  I am crossing my fingers about the washer and dryer.  This business is so bad, I am considering contacting Channel 12 Call for Action - Consumer Advocate.",

After I arrived there, I was informed that my reservation had been moved to a location on North Rancho regardless of what my reservation said that I printed from the U-Haul website! So I drive to the second location only to be told that I need to go to a third location. I go to the other location and am informed by a much friendlier person that there are no 26' trucks in town period. I am then sent back to the second location to pick up a 20' truck and when I get there, I am informed that there are no 20' trucks available. I tried calling the Oso Blanca location to find out if they have any 20' trucks available and am put on hold by the same rude young lady I had already dealt with. After being on hold for five minutes, I hung up and called back two or three more times to speak with management and now they won't even answer my phone call. They send me straight to hold. Horrible customer service, horrible empathy for their customer, horrible communication between locations. If I were the owner/manager here, I would work really hard to make sure this never happens again to any customers. This place is a great example of the direction that customer service has gone in Las Vegas. I will never do business with them again and will tell all my neighbors to go elsewhere. Could have saved me a whole lot of trouble by doing a little research and making phone calls. Would leave a zero star if I could, they don't deserve one.",

The restaurant does not open until 4:00pm on Sunday - we arrived about 1/2 hour early and watched several people try to open the door to the restaurant.  Once it approached 4:00pm there was a line up down the sidewalk.  My family was the first in the restaurant and were very quickly seated.  Almost immediately a pitcher of water was brought to the table.\n\nOur party (5 people) had one vegetarian in it so we tried to order menu items that would appeal to both.  In the end we got vegetable fried rice, vegetable pakoras, kung pao beef, green beans and broccoli and black mushrooms.  All portions were huge and delicious - the vegetable pakoras were enjoyed by everyone!  When our bill arrived, I couldn't believe it was under $50.  Will definitely go back!",

    "text": "Arrived at 8:15pm on a Friday night and had to wait 20min for a table for three, the place is small and there's not many tables due to the partitions that seclude each table. We were fortunate that some other tables before us gave up on waiting as that helped shorten the wait time, and you can easily pass the time by thinking about what to order as the dine in and take out menu are the same.\n\nEach table is partitioned off so you don't look face to face with any other tables, and even keeps the noise down. The seclusion creates a more intimate ambiance and let's you focus on your food and your company as opposed to checking out what others ordered. However this makes it a bit tougher for waiters to see you, so actively raise your hand if you need something. \n\nWe ordered a sushi and sashimi combo (~40pcs), 2 miso soups, and a seaweed salad to share among three girls. It was the perfect amount of food as the sushi had reasonable amounts of rice, the sashimi was reasonably sized, and the seaweed salad was a good portion for the price. All in all I had no complaints about the food. The fish was fresh and the rice was well flavoured and stuck together with the fish for the sushi. Plating was simple but still attractive - great for photos!\n\nAll in all, from an à la carte sushi perspective I had no complaints, the price to quality was reasonable and quality was on the good side. I did notice that tempura orders are a little skimpy for the price, and the variety of dons, bentos, and noodles is limited. There's a large variety of specialty rolls, though majority of them are generic fillings that cater to a wider audience (raw fish eaters and non-raw fish eaters). I would've liked to see more specialty items and variety in their combo deals.",

My chicken salad wrap was pretty good, but I'll pass on the pasta salad side next time. The most annoying part was the busboy cart constantly passing us as we were finishing our lunch. It was like Jaws was circling us waiting for us to get up. I can understand wanting to turn tables, but don't make it so obvious.\n\nIt took quite a while for us to actually pay for our meal, since the line for paying was long as well.\n\nLike I said, the place is good. Would I wait over 10-15 minutes for a table? Not likely.",

There have been many instances where she's shown me that she truly cares for my dogs and money is not a motivating factor for her.  I'm so glad my friends referred her to me.  One of my dogs has a serious disease and I met with more than 7 vets to get their opinions.  Dr. Costa is the only one I completely trusted to operate on her and treat her.  The other vet at this office (a male. I forgot his name) seems more money motivated.  He recommended expensive treatments and tests my dog didn't need.  Now when I schedule an appointment, I make sure to ask for Dr. Costa. \n\nAlso, I boarded my dogs here for a weekend. I checked out other kennels but they were stinky and nasty.  Their facility is clean and reasonably priced.  One of my dogs got sick when he was there like he always does when he has separation anxiety.  I was very glad the vet was there to give him medicine.  I don't know if regular kennels do that, but I was glad that Dr. Costa was around when he needed her.",

Je devrai certainement revenir, et je ne me suis même pas encore assise!!!\nJ'ai dû faire un gros effort pour revenir au menu du souper qui, lui aussi, était très appétissant. \n\nNous avions droit à un mélange de tapas chauds, froids et de la mer. Je ne me souviens peu des plats choisis, puisque la visite date de plus de 4 mois, mais je me souviens que chaque plat était extrêmement bien présenté, incorporant des fleurs et sauces en déco délicieuse. Tout ce qu'on a mangé était incroyablement bon (dont le tartare de bœuf, lui, je m'en rappelle!) et j'aurais aimé continuer l'expérience en  goûtant à tout! On a tenté, avec le dessert, mais, les faisant maison, il ne restait malheureusement plus nos choix.\n\nNous avons choisi de manger au bar, et nous avions la vue sur la cuisine, presque de maison, où travaillait la chef. Impressionnant de voir d'où sortaient ces merveilleux plats!\n\nPetit bémol : Avec notre escompte de 50%, nous trouvions que le prix pour 2 boissons, les taxes et le pourboire était correct, mais sans notre deal, on aurait trouvé ça coûteux.\n\nMission déjeuner un jour!!",

All the food tasted rich and bold.  I found the vegetarian items more spicy than the meat items.  The butter chicken was good but The Host's was better.  The curry goat was delicious.  The tantoori chicken tasted good and not too dry.  The only thing I was sure that needed improvement was the naan.

    "text": "First off I have to start off saying that we came here because of a coupon we bought off one of the many coupon sites out there. We were very happy we did and will certainly be back. We started off with the garlic edamame and I think it was the best garlic edamame that I have ever had. It had actual specs of garlic throughout and they tasted like they were almost cooked in butter as well as the garlic. Hubby and I couldn't eat them fast enough and were probably secretly racing each other to see who could eat the most! When we were almost finished with those our order of the House Special Pan Fried Noodles arrived. We were both amazed at the quantity and thought for sure there was no way we would be able to eat it all. The flavor was right on and they did not skimp on the protein at all. Plenty of chicken, pork, and shrimp through out. My only negative is the pork was a tad chewy and not as flavorful as it could've been. We really had to pace ourselves and not eat too much of it however because we still had our sushi coming out. The first to arrive was the Scorpion Roll.   It turned out to be a wonderful roll and the sauce they served it on really accentuated the flavors of the sushi. Shortly after it arrived our Sashimi platter was served. This is what I had been looking forward to and I was not disappointed! The pieces of fish were very large and thick and required each to be cut into two bites when eating. We were very impressed with the freshness and quality of it. I had contemplated trying one of their desserts; however, neither one of us could even think about finishing the rest of our pan fried noodle entrée, let alone ordering dessert. We did see that one has to get here early as the place filled up very quickly once we were sat down. And several people waiting for tables upon our leaving. Both hubby and I really enjoyed our meal and will definitely be back!",

And to my understanding, Presto Cafe's motto is \"healthy comfort food\" and I couldn't agree more! It truly is healthy and it's just better than comfort food. \n\nThe turkey sandwhich had the sweet and savory taste so it was unique but also became the best turkey sandwhich I've ever had in my life. i was actually full from a half of the sandwhich and took the other half home. I needed it as comfort food from eating the first half lol. \n\nI dined in and it was served on a dish, well prepared and just so yummy looking! It also came with a mini salad on the side of the sandwich with greens, and green apple and strawberry slices!\n\nI like how nice the cook and cashier were and I think they were the only workers there at the time which was okay because it wasn't that busy and they also cleaned up after us as well! The wait time was quick and the quality of food was awesome! I'm glad I tried this place out because I never knew healthy food could ever taste so great! \n\nI'm a huge fan now and you will be too when you try it out!

Great deal and great cranberry & Grey Goose cocktails.\n\nOnly complaint was that the washroom was closed immediately following the show but I can understand why - they were getting ready for new patrons to enter.\n\nTo be fair, the only other Cirque show I've seen is Zumanity, but I'd recommend this one to my friends.",

If your doctor recommends compression garments I HIGHLY recommend this place.\n\nAfter my doctor prescribed compression stockings I looked around for a place to get them from and this was on the list.

They let me know what I would need to bring to my appointment.\n\nUpon arrival I completed the check in process on their tablet and sat down to wait. I was called back very shortly and taken to a room. They went through health questions and took some pictures of my legs and some initial measurements. Then after seeing that I would need custom stockings made they needed to bring someone else in to do further measurements. They went ahead and got everything needed for the order and had me select the colors I would want. Then the women explained to me what additional information would be needed to get my insurance to approve the order. She also set me up with an appointment to pick up my stockings.\n\nThe office and waiting room are very nice. The staff is all welcoming, friendly and helpful. The woman helping me went above and beyond doing everything she could to help me. I will not pick up my stockings for a while yet but so far the whole experience has gone smoothly.

    "text": "It's midnight and a half and I've got the munchies after spending an evening at the poolside drinking ciders and chatting with a great friend. I take the dog out for her nighttime walk and to grab the mail, and once I get home I go through the stack of weekly flyers that jam my mailbox when I come across a familiar name: Geno's. \n\n   Now this name means something to me. Geno's is my favourite cheesesteak, experienced a number of times during trips out to Philadelphia and perpetually missed. I feel some misgivings about seeing a new place that has blatantly stolen the name of a landmark, but decide to give them a shot having been wooed by their big bold claims of being open super-late.\n\n   I had passed by the location earlier in the day so finding Geno's was easy peasy, and at 1am there was no line so my order was in quick as a whistle. I mill about, impressed at a massive array of hot sauces on the counter but otherwise bored by the blatant ZOMGPHILADELPHIA decor.  In a very reasonable time the cute girl behind the counter hands me a foil tube which felt a bit light, but still held promise of tasty times.\n\n   Rather than eating in, I bring the 'steak home to give the meat juices and \"cheese sauce\" (apparently not cheese whiz) proper time to soak into the roll. Unrolling it, I notice that the paper wrapper inside the foil is remarkably clean,  and my heart sinks a bit at the suggestion of a lack of the aforementioned meat juice and 'whiz. I finish unwrapping the 'steak and find a roll unlike the soft, spongy bread that I'm used to, rather one that is a little dry and crusty on the edges and dusted with corn meal. \n\n   I ordered a whole because I'm not a little girl, so I tear the 'steak in half and notice how little meat is in the sandwich, so little that there's an entire inch and a half at one end of the sandwich that has no filling at all. Not good, but I'm in this for the long haul. I take my first bite into a center bit, and while the flavor is okay, it is markedly dry and not nearly gooey with 'whiz enough. I soldier on and notice a great inconsistency in the onions, some cut into thin strips and others still in big chunks. The rest of the sandwich was as dry as the first bite and the corn meal dusting on the bread distracts from what flavor was there. \n\n   In the end, I really don't feel like I got my nine bucks worth of cheesesteak so I'm going to file this place away as a late-night desperation call, but definitely never a first choice.",

The last night I was here the music selection was great which is neither here nor there. \n\nThe one ding - the crepe cake doesn't taste as good as it looks. \n\nOne surprise - the brownie sundae is really good and the presentation makes it a wonderful ig post for all you influencers and wanna be influencers. \n\nI'm not much of a coffee drinker but their lattes seem pretty popular. \n\nMain course, the honey toast is basically a build your own sundae big enough for two ppl to share. There are also plenty of pictures and recommended builds you can go with.",

We got 1/2 lb of ribs, 1 lb of brisket, 1/2 lb of turkey, a potato, potato salad and bread. We picked it up and back to the room. We had bread with no butter, had a potato with no butter and no potato salad. Very disappointing. But we still had meat. Ribs were without flavor even with all their different sauces. Turkey was dry with no flavor and even the brisket was the best out of the three, that's not saying much for Rudy's.  We were very sad that the food and service was this bad. There is nothing we like about it and yes we read the reviews and went any way. Don't do what we did just pick another place to go. We weren't inside long, but glad we didn't stay music was to loud.",

I left several messages on the voice mail never to receive a call back when I finally spoke to someone I was told that I would be wait listed until the 18th of March but the person I spoke with never took my number.  Also she told me she had people in front of her so she was unable to continue the conversation with me.  This is the first time I have ever spoken with a facility and the caller does not receive the attention he/she deserves.  I called back today and I guess I got the owner and she told me she never authorized the waitlist and I had 6 months to use the coupon and it is not her fault if I waited until the last minute to use it but  the ironic thing about it is if I go online to pay for the class they have room available for the paying customer but not for the customer who purchased via groupon which sucks.  I will tell everyone I know to pick another studio for your fitness needs. I guess this is the place to go to if you have a large party but not for the individual who prepaid for their pole dancing classes :(",

Once this new management took over they started playing favorites and treating customers terribly. They have \"regulars\" that go there all the time (half of them are dating the bartenders) and if a regular doesn't like someone that person gets kicked out immediately. Don't waste your money/time.

I think this is a gem for not only Mississauga but west end GTA, as there are no other really decent alternatives for awesome doughnuts in the area. I can imagine the workers of this place often times feeling like a Canada post worker, cause customers have to be overloading this location to the breaking point almost daily. my most recent experience leads me to take a star off of my review, cause going through the drive thru was pretty painful on two aspects. number one, the drive through is split into a tee formation, so people from the parking lot can enter, and people coming in from the side street can also come in, so depending on the approach you might get bumped a spot or two back in line. secondly the wait time going through this drive-thru is pretty painful to be honest. the whole ordeal took well over ten minutes from time or entry to driving away. very happy with the product and the consistency, I know from a \"assembly line standpoint\" it takes time, but its a bit frustrating. the staff are super friendly, lots of parking, and the location is generally clean. \nif you buy two dozen doughnuts, you actually get a discount on the second dozen, which still comes in at under 20 bucks.",

A monstrosity appeared as my meal and at first I was quite worried due to the size that it would not be great.  Fortunately, the dish was succulent and despite my better judgement I finished all of the huge platter of 2 poached eggs and corned beef, although I did leave much of the hollandaise sauce as it was too much.  The wait staff were attentive and I was able to try a number of microbrew Stouts with the Irish eggs benedict (these went together quite well) as my glass never was quite finished before they asked if I wanted another.  There is also an incredible scotch cabinet as you walk in the door.  This is one of the best collections of scotch that I have seen outside of NYC.",

Decent deals for drinks and appetizers (apps) at happy hour.\n\nNoticed this place as a new restaurant in downtown that serves ramen, so I decided to try it out since ramen (or good ramen) is hard to find or basically non existent in Pittsburgh. I initially made a reservation at 6:30, and since I was worried I would be late I called in and they seemed totally chill about it.. turns out when I got there I noticed there was nobody else in the restaurant at Thursday ~6:45 PM so that made me a little uneasy.\n\nSince it was still happy hour, I ordered an old maid ($5) and the spicy karage - fried chicken ($4). Both were pretty good.. basically tasted exactly as you might expect.\n\nBut let's focus on the ramen cuz that's the main point of the restaurant. I ordered the Rayu Paitan with the hot sauce on the side. Im from the Bay Area, so maybe my standards are too high but nothing about the ramen was special to me besides the bowl they put it in. My main disappointment was in the noodles, which I thought did not have a good texture. They seemed too soft and bland, and in my opinion for good ramen they need to be nice and chewy. I'm not a huge fan of chicken broth based ramen, so I wished they had sesame based options, like kuro ramen which is my favorite. Three slices of pork belly, egg, and corn.. but none of it really stood out.\n\nPositives: Pretty friendly and helpful staff. Nicely decorated for a good vibe and also a good place to talk since it wasn't loud (but then again no one was there).",

Unlike other places in the area where there is so much choice, Stay chooses to focus on a few key menu items that seem to be popular with patrons. The place is pretty clean and has better seating now,  accommodating up to 60 people with accent lighting throughout. Service is good to start, but during the end of the meal it was clear they were understaffed, took us about 15 min to get the bill.\n\nFood is where this place loses stars, the flavors are great, good main entrees and average sizes; the problem here is freshness. Everything is pretty much frozen or canned, my sticky rice was more like a paste and the squid was rubbery. On the plus side, the popcorn chicken and other desserts were really good. Compared to other places in the area that do things fresh within a similar price range Stay has a hard time holding its own.",

But the service was polite and you could tell these guys work their ass off, so at the end of the day they get my respect, and when there are big lineups during peak hours you have to practice patience.

The salad was good, but very basic - a lot of lettuce, chicken, lettuce ... you get the picture..  The breakfast was good.

Not only do they mix the hash browns with cheese and put a layer of it all around the inside of the tortilla/burrito, but the addition of the grilled chicken, then topping it with tapatio really made it fantastic.\n\nI was so happy.

We were exhausted from flying from the East Coast (so I'm sure we were a little bit off our game) BUT: the confirmations we received were so much appreciated (they called us), the limo driver coming to our hotel and taking us back (we did have to wait just a little bit for the driver to take us back to the hotel, but hey, he was a busy guy). It is mandatory tipping, every chapel is, and tipping all together 120 dollars for one of the most reasonable Elvis packages- it was worth it. I'm pretty sure we bought the basic package (I think it was the hound dog), everything was included, limo/photos/singing-- I couldn't believe it! Also, outside, the building does look a little hokey, inside is your standard (perhaps cheaper) wedding décor, the ceremony-it will be quick! including the limo rides, I think the whole schbang was one hour, and there might only be two guys that you'll see. We saw only the photographer/who was also the cashier, the wedding director, etc. and Elvis (very upbeat). :P However, the TWO of them is what made the experience is so great. Their rapport with each other, the jokes they told, that was the icing on the cake. All in the all the experience was wonderful, kind of quick (but in Vegas, that's okay! plenty of other things to do) and not breaking the bank.",

We had no idea of reputation before going, so we were very pleasantly surprised with how great it was!\n\nAs they say \"good things come to those who wait.\" We were warned when we arrived that the food takes a little longer because they cook everything fresh, unlike other Chinese food restaurants where the food is pre-prepared, and then just served. Having said that however, we did not find the wait to be all that long. We were provided with three different menus - the one with dishes that one would order at any North American Chinese restaurant, the traditional fare menu (in English and Mandarin), and the lunch menu.\n\nThe food was, as they said, very fresh. I found it quite spicy, but not in a bad way. My lunch was delicious. I had ginger beef with steamed rice and fresh vegetables. The portions were just right. It was so nice to be able to have Chinese food without all that dough and deep fried, sugary food.\n\nThe service was friendly and professional. I would definitely go here again.",

The warehouse can be quite tricky to find.  You have to drive to the back of the building for parking and the lot looks like 10 land mine had blew up.  After you park the fun begins.  Sign up is fairly quick and painless.  My only complain is that they don't have change rooms besides using their washroom.  \n\nFrom the outside it would appear to be a small gym but I was surprised to walk into a huge gym.  Lots of wall and a variety of level for beginners and advance climbers.  One thing that stood out about this gym is that it caters young climbers with a party area for kids.  There was a birthday party when I was there; not sure if that was just a coincidence or just the norm for Oasis.  Although there were a lot of climbers that day, the wait was minimal to non existent thanks to numerous walls built inside.\n\nI give Oasis 3 stars because the gym is a little old and wasn't as clean as compared to newer gym like True North but that doesn't mean Rock Oasis won't satisfy climbers of all level.  I had a great time and would not hesitate to go back.",

There was one weird incident when we were asked if another guest could share our table... we declined; it was awkward, but we still enjoyed the rest of our afternoon.\n\nThe afternoon tea is a bit pricey at around $45/person but you get a lot of tasty treats and my pot was refilled (on request) at no additional charge. (At $12 a pot, if you skip the full afternoon tea spread, this could be a pretty economical way to enjoy a great view in a classy setting on the strip, sans alcohol.)\n\nThey have a decent selection of basic teas; my husband went for a jasmine green and I had the Mandarin blend, which was black tea flavored subtly with (you guessed it) mandarin orange. The scones were delicious and so was the Devonshire cream and jam that accompanied them. We also had curry chicken, egg salad, black forest ham and smoked salmon sandwiches, as well as some very cute mini desserts (including my favorite, the sparkly purple macaron).\n\nI really enjoyed myself and I think my husband did, too!

We had a side room for our group of 12+ and the service was okay, not great.  Being in any side room, it's hard to flag down your waiter or waitress if you need something.  My main complaint is that I ordered the Yummy Chicken and it wasn't yummy.  :-(  It was really spicy and that wasn't in the menu description.  I probably should have ordered a burger or sandwich, but I wanted an entree for dinner.  i would have sent it back if I wasn't with a big group.  I just didn't want to make a big deal of it, so my man shared some of his food with me which was just okay.  I'm sad to see that it's Chef Aaron Sanchez running this restaurant because I like him on TV.\n\nSTEEL PANTHER:  Fun overall, but we didn't like the opening band that night at all.  The opener took way too long and I didn't know that Steel Panther's actual show would be so looooong.  Our group of friends at the show (maybe 10 of us?), only 4 of us made it to the end of the show.  I know, we're getting old (in our 30s)... but the show was kind of dragged out.

I've only had one visit, so I'm basing this off that one experience. \n\nI called and Justin Gray was kind enough to look up my car's warranty information and everything else about my 3 year old car that I'd just purchased. He proceeded to tell me that all of my maintenance was included, sweet, but when I tried to make a reservation, he told me cannot take them. This was weird, as all of my VW/Audi experiences the advisors themselves had the power to take a reservation, even though there was a reservation girl. Ok whatever, I'll go with it. The girl taking the reservation ended up having to call Justin to find out if they had the correct part in to do the work... so do you think we could have just eliminated the middle man?\n\nSecondly, there are no complimentary loaner cars. Again I'm going to relate this to my VW/Audi experiences, where they would always provide me with a complimentary loaner, even if it was just one afternoons worth of work. Instead, I had to pay Hertz $6, not like it is a lot, but it's the principle of it. \n\nDo not let them wash your car. Whatever kind of oil they use is a dust magnet, they don't wash it correctly, and miss a lot of places. It actually made me kind of nervous after seeing what they did beacause it was obvious it was done in a careless manner. I also don't like when people move my seat... you're only driving my car for a number of feet, not from here to Chicago, you don't have to move it for that. Leave it be.\n\nOn positive notes every service person I encountered was courteous, helpful, and efficent. It was obvious management was making them do certain things in certain ways that didn't always make sense, but that wasn't their fault. Inspection 1 with oil change and all only took about 4 hours which isn't bad for a dealer. I was pleased with the courteous service and efficency.",

Finally went on a Friday shortly after 9pm, and I was surprised that we were the only people in the restaurant... Already kind of a red flag as every other spot in Chinatown would be full pretty much. But we stayed, not wanting to pass a judgment so soon. Ordered karaage to share, and I chose the most popular kome chashu ramen while my companion chose the white chashu ramen. The karaage was very good, big pieces of chicken. I liked my ramen enough but we both thought that it was on the overly oily side. She didn't really care for hers though, because the soup was really bland and despite putting in a lot of condiments from the table, couldn't salvage it. I tried the soup and felt the same thing. The fact that the ramen was already more expensive than the other places in town, and the fact that it didn't really taste any better at all, really answered my question of how we could have been the only people in the restaurant on a Friday night. And despite being the only people there, service was still slow and lacking, with us having to ask for water refills and plates so we could share our karaage. Won't be back.",

    "text": "Vegas is known for interesting, delectable fare, and Bouchon fits perfectly into that description. We decided to patron Bouchon after reading some yelp reviews, and looking up the creator, Thomas Keller. Although yelp has it down as casual, the overall aesthetic was much classier. To be fair, they didn't refuse us service for our subpar attire, but I get the feeling that flops and shorts would be frowned upon. \n\nWe arrived a little before our reservation, and so we waited at the bar and helped ourselves to a cocktail while we waited. The bartender's mix and presentation was superb; exactly what you'd expect for a 12$ cocktail. \n\nOnce sat, we were greeted by an ever rotating service staff that seemed to have extremely niche positions. First in the parade was our head waiter, who showed us the menu (hint: it's wrapped around the napkin!) and immediately assuaged us without seeming condescending. Next in line was our baker, who's sole point was to constantly keep us breaded, buttered, and pistachioed. Since Keller also has a Bouchon bakery, we weren't shocked to find the bread was crusty deliciousness. Out waiter returned and I decided to quiz him on his menu knowledge. He scored a perfect grade. \n\nAt his suggestion, we tried three cheeses as a sampler. We had a musette, cheddar, and a goat's milk cheese. All three had exactly the flavor profile described by our waiter, and were paired with a scrumptious dob of honey and a apple sliced fanned out.\n\nAt this point, the dedicated drink carafe holder had made an appearance, as well as our table clearer, who doubled as a utensil swapper. I've never used a single utensil for so brief a time. \n\nThe main course arrived - lamb for myself, a gourmet bacon salad for my friend - and was, as expected, excellent. For dessert, we enjoyed the signature Bouchon (miniature brownies topped with pumpkin ice cream, over a toasted marshmallow base). \n\nBetween the fantastically attentive and personal service, to the gorgeous presentation and overall tastiness of the meal, Bouchon easily earns a 4 out of 5. The food was delicious, but the flavors were relatively unidimensional and didn't quite reach that delightful level where you're left satisfied but craving more.",

They also didn't come with jam or whipped cream! What the heck! Then I ordered the donuts and they were pretty good. But of course, it's a donut.\n\nThe menu looked like an old newspaper, which is nice and goes with the vintage style of the restaurant. But the cutlery was tarnished and the mugs and plates were dusty. I think they went overboard with \"vintage\".\n\nMy meal, which was potatoes and brisket was overly salty. It slowly made my teeth ache. \n\nThe waiter made multiple mistakes with my bill, overcharged me, and then asked, \"Is this okay? Sorry, should I reverse it?\" - No, I love paying extra for bad food!",

The flavors worked well together.\nThe poached eggs was a solid yolk, this seems to be standard, out of the five Bennys I have had across the three locations I have had one runny yolk.\n\nWhen we were leaving my aunt bought a box of cookies.

We sat in excellent seats in the 100 level where they deliver food/beer to your seat. The beers are expensive ($10), but they have a decent selection - Canadian, Coors Light, Rickards Red or MGD. They also serve wine in the type of mini plastic wine glasses that you might find at the dollar store, and have plastic bottles of Smirnoff Ice (take note Laura T.). The food selection is much better than the Rogers Centre. There's Mr Sub, Pizza Pizza, Burkie's Hot Dogs, Edo Japan sushi, burgers and fries, Hagen Das bars, popcorn, cotton candy, snickers, mars, twix, m&ms, twizzlers (am i missing any?! - it's easy to memorize because the weirdo dudes who sells the treats sprints up and down the aisles about 1,000 times in a game). Other pros? It's connected to Union Stn, so easy to get to on the TTC/Go Train. The bathrooms were big and clean. The Raptors dancers were pretty good, but RapTOR (the mascot) totally stole the show in his bubble head outfit.",

    "text": "This was a spontaneous drop by as my date and I were looking for a random izakaya. The atmosphere and decor was really nice. (Minus for one obnoxious loud table, which the waitress kindly moved us upon request) It was a nice, chill, and quiet place to hang out but still have fun. I loved the water pumping device haha\n\nFood wise I didn't know what to expect but we were really happy with the choices.\n\nTuna Goma Ae 4/5\nReally good! The dressing with the spinach and bonito worked soo well. The texture of the tuna was not as firm as I would have liked so, I would go for the straight spinach next time.  For the spinach alone,it would be 5/5.\n\nSashimi 10 piece 4/5\nQuite fresh! The salmon and mackerel were our favourites.\n\nSushi combo 3/5\nPretty good too. But tbh I wouldn't just come here just for the sushi, I would put the money towards other dishes.\n\nYaki tori set A 4.5/5\nThis came with pork belly, king mushroom, strip loin,  scallop, and mune cheese. We loved the pork belly and strip loin a lot. Pork belly has a great crunch on the skin,  not too fatty, and nice salty taste. Strip loin was very tender! The mushrooms and scallop was both sweet and juicy. My date was meh about the chicken but it really grew on me. The flavours of the cheese and chicken work nicely and it was really tender. I suggest eating from lightest in taste to strongest to get the best flavour out of it. \nScallop, mushroom, strip loin, mune cheese, then pork belly.\n\nMentaiko 5/5\nThis had such a great grill flavour that worked soo well with the spicy and salty fish eggs. I loved this a lot even though it was quite salty. Just eat it with something or a drink.\n\nAburi shima saba 4.5/5\nI really liked this but my date LOVED this. The seared outside brought out a subtle buttery flavour that worked well with the cured fish. Rather small portion for the price but we enjoyed it.\n\nEdamame 5/5\nYou can't go wrong with $1 Edamame!  It was nice, unlike some places where it's been cooked to death, this was very plump , flavourful , and great starter.\n\nWe took advantage of the 15% off sake and got Tamano Hikari. Nice sooth sake that got more aromatic ans flavourful as you drank it. Overall, the service, ambience, and food was very good. Prices are a little much for the portions but still very good. Take advantage of the weekly specials discounts :)",

    "text": "I went here at 5am, because I couldn't sleep and needed a hearty breakfast before heading north for some snowboarding later in the morning, and Mars Diner wasn't open that morning (they are only open 24 hours on the weekends).\n\nThe restaurant is very nice inside. A sort of retro luxe diner vibe going on, with a cool mix of jazz/blues/motown music playing in the background.\nEventhough I was the only customer at the restaurant and there was a staff of dozen in attendance, the service was very spotty and unattentive.\n\nOnly the breakfast menu was available at the time I was there, which was perfectly fine and I love breakfast anytime of day or night. Being a benny lover I ordered the eggs benedict, which at $12 I thought it was very reasonable. The food arrived fast and why wouldn't it be as they were not exactly busy.\n\nThe food was presented nicely on a cast iron skillet, however the skillet was just decorative as it wasn't even hot. The wooden tray that held the skillet was warped so the whole skillet wobbled annoyingly when I dug into the food.  The portion was rather small, and the benedict was extremely bland and boring, as were the roasted potatoes. The caramelized onions were the only nice component on the dish, and I tried to spread the onions over every portion of eggs and potatoes.\nFor being such a mediocre dish with no flavor and being a smallish portion, $12 was actually overpriced for what it is.\n\nThe coffee was good, but not $3 good. I would rather head over to Jimmy's a block away for cup of their awesome coffee for much less.\n\nI was disappointed that my waitor was not very attentive during my meal. I had to flag one of the staff's attention to get his attention so I could get a refill of coffee. They were all chatting with each other, which is perfectly fine at this time of day and lacking any customers, but they could at least check up at my table every so often. The waitor was apologetic, but later on he simply disappeared when I wanted to get my check.\n\nThe three flat screen TVs above the bar and the cleaning lady moping the floors kept me entertained as I waited for my waitor to show up.\nI eventually had to walk into the kitchen to get a staff member to get my check.\n\nMy meal came to $15, which normally is a reasonable amount for a good breakfast. But for the poor service, boring food, and measley portions it's overpriced, and I was kicking myself for leaving a $3 tip, as I should've left a 10% tip, but I didn't have any change.",

Two buffets and 2 drafts came out to be 55.00. ???? There is absolutely NO flavour in their food.  I'm not talking about hot/spicy I'm talking about the normal spices you find in all authentic Indian dishes. If you want spicy do not even WISH that you will receive anything remotely close, even if you ask for an addition. Their suggestion is a carrot/oil mix which has no spice and has the distinction of canola oil. No lime pickle, or methi on the menu. Everything from the buffet was cold.

My friend and I sat at the high top table right inside the lounge and let the high class customer service begin. I wanted to try something different than what my usual order is at Mastros City Hall. We started with the meat and cheese plate. Every cheese and meat was of high quality and flavorful. I ordered the Chilean sea bass with the creme brûlée corn Asa a side. Every bite was AHHMazing. This place is on my list to come back..sooner rather than later.",

Nothing too complicated, just pick the size of your pizza, the toppings you like, and enjoy the pizza.\n\nMy group ordered a large 18in. pizza with the following: Tomato sauce, parmesan cheese, kalamata olives, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and roasted red peppers.\n\nThe hearty topping provided great flavors to the pizza; while the thin crust provided a great crunchy texture.\n\nThe way they baked the thin crust was well balanced. Portions of the crust were crunchy, while other portions were slightly softened by the moist topping.\n\nOverall, a great casual pizzeria that is more than able to fulfill one's pizza cravings.",

Well, over this past weekend Joe (the owner) posted our rzr on a AZ Rzr form and is selling the \"custom\"'wrap job that we had on our rzr. He has put it on truck tailgates and is advertising it for other Rzr too! We were advise at the beginning from Ryan Campbell that they are a custom shop and take pride in the work that they do. They would never duplicate our graphic nor anyone else's. I'm very disappointed in ASC custom graphic for breaking that contract with us. It's poor business practice and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone!!!",

    "text": "My lunch at Lock & Dam was probably one of the best meals out I've had since moving to Pittsburgh seven months ago. It's in a totally unassuming store front across the street from the zoo- which is how my family and I ended up there. Post-zoo we were starving and my husband had heard that the food at Lock & Dam was supposed to be really good. I don't think he was prepared for HOW good it was, though. I certainly wasn't. \n\nMy husband ordered a hot dog with mac n cheese on it, I ordered a Junkyard burger, and we ordered our two year old his very first cheeseburger. The first thing we noticed, when we brought the tray to the table, was that the food served for the price paid was beyond fair. Huuuuge burgers and dogs stacked high with premium toppings. I honest-to-G-d let out a satisfied moaning sound as a bit into this burger. I was like, beyond hungry at this point and I couldn't believe my good luck at what I was eating. Picky toddler even went HAM on his burger and, like I said, he has about five meals he will reliably eat... none of which are hamburgers lol.\n\nThe cherry on top of the experience was the business owner, who also cooked our food that afternoon. He was the most pleasant person who checked in with us about how we were enjoying our meal and genuinely seemed pleased that we thought it was so delicious. I don't want to blow up the spot, but he even gave us a couple little extras on the house that sweetened the experience even further.\n\nThere's really no question in our minds that we will be returning to have lunches at Lock & Dam every time we find ourselves having family day at the zoo. We have a zoo membership and spring and summer are right around the corner so I'm sure I'll be working my way through that burger menu.\n\nGet yourself here, ASAP!",

    "text": "Welcome Diner is dead. The new location has lost all of the charm and ambiance that drew people to eat there in the first place. I feel like they should have named it Millennial in a Quarter Life Crisis Diner because this restaurant is having an identity crisis. It seems like the interior decor was designed by a 55 year old who looked at a Buzzfeed list of things millennials like and then just crammed all of them into the building without taking into account that they don't all go together. In the diner there is old milk cartons turned into seats, disco balls, pinatas, plants in hanging macrame holders, and your receipt comes in an old book. And yes while all those things can be neat when used well, that is not the case here. Additionally, I feel the food quality has gone down. The portions seemed smaller and the quality of the meat just wasn't there. Previously, you could taste the high quality meat in the burger. Not anymore. The patio was fine. However, the lightning could be improved. It was too harsh. All in all this now feels like a restaurant you would find in Downtown Gilbert.",

Most of their business seems to be take out. \n\nFor appetizers we got the chicken lollipop and manchurian, both were quite good. \n\nFor the main course we got veg hakka chowmein (noodles) and veg manchurian fried rice. The entree dishes were garlic chicken, thai chicken, veg manchurian balls, veg sweet and sour balls, and chilli potato. The portions are huge and we ended up taking some of the food home.\n\nThe food is regular chinese hakka food - oily and spicy/hot. Not the best I've had in the GTA, there are better options in Mississauga and Scarborough, but for someone that lives downtown, it's a good option to have \"in\" the city.\n\nService leaves much to be desired. The server waiting on was impatient and almost rude. My friend had a couple of questions about the menu, and her body language suggested that she thought we were wasting her time. I understand that she probably had a busy day, but if you are mean to customers, then you probably shouldn't be in the service business to begin with.\n\nAll in all, an average experience. Flavours are meh, but if you're someone who values quantity over quality, this could be what you're looking for. \n\nWe spent about $20-$25 per person, which included a drink each.",

    "text": "I just had my wedding here in the Venus Garden. Valerie Thornton was my first contact. She was helpful and got our package set up, but was slightly less responsive once we had our package booked. Then Rebecca Proffitt was our wedding coordinator. She won't really get in touch with you until about 4 weeks or less before your wedding, but she does respond within about 24 hours. The grounds are beautiful, the minister was great, the pianist was great and the photographer was also pretty good. While this place is definitely a wedding mill -- and every single thing adds up, I still would have it here again. The weather was perfect, Rebecca was very sweet, and the place just has a very intimate and romantic feel to it. I had my wedding in December, so I can't speak to loud music at the pool area (which is right behind the garden)  because no one was in the pool in December, but that could be an issue if you choose to have your wedding during the warmer seasons. It might also be irritating to walk around the pool area (you have to walk through the pool area to get to the garden) with all the wet puddles on the ground from people splashing around. This, again, wasn't a factor for me because it wasn't pool season during my wedding. I'd highly recommend this place for a wedding in the winter. Still very temperate and beautiful, and we also got  a deal with the pricing since it's low wedding season. The only other thing which isn't particuarly great is that the photography packages are very expensive. The photos did come out pretty good though, so that was a nice surprise. Overall, would recommend as we had a good experience here.",

Plus you get $10 off your first order of $50 or more and you can refer friends to use the service as well and if they do they'll get $10 off their first order and you will also get an additional $10 off your next order. The service is great you don't even have to get out of your car they bring it right up and load all of the items for you and typically bring you a cold bottled water for your drive home.  Farrah was the associate today and she was excellent!

It's another one of the finds in Vegas that gives me a feeling of being back at home in Columbus (OH)! Some may describe it has \"Hipster\" - and rightfully so... just don't grab from that, that it's Snobby Hipster. Park on Fremont is the approachable Hipster. The Hipster with an Android phone. The Hipster that doesn't quite commit to riding bicycles EVERYWHERE and sometimes grabs an Uber. \n\nPark is pretty small inside, so plan to venture outdoors as there is plenty of outdoor seating. But if you sit inside, avoid that back booth, unless you've got really small thighs. I mean REALLY small thighs. My friends and I once sat in that back booth and we had a hard time getting in/out. The bar is pretty cool though and the bartenders all seem pretty cool as well. \n\nMy favorite thing about Park, aside from the chicken and waffle sandwich, is the secret garden in the back... so be sure to explore your surroundings! \n\nI've ordered a cheeseburger and fries, chicken and waffle sandwich and wings and fries. Park has some of the best French fries! They're always the right amount of crisp. The cheeseburger was pretty standard, but the wings I had ordered really surprised me. The Chipotle BBQ sauce that they used is really good! Not too much of a kick but just enough to leave you wanting more. \n\nMy absolute FAVORITE dish there though is the Chicken and Waffle sandwich. It's pretty big so bring your appetite if you're going to be ordering this dish. There is a fried chicken breast nestled between two waffles and some bacon. The chicken is the perfect amount of crispy and juicy. You also get syrup which makes the waffle easier to bite into. You have your choice of a side, I've (so far) gotten it with a salad and sweet potato tots. Go with the tots, they're pretty darn good as well! \n\nPark has an awesome (brunch) drink special - $20 for a bottle of champagne and enough orange juice to make quite a few mimosas out of. So if you're looking for a downtown brunch spot to drink, go to Park!",

Maybe the owner and staff doesn't realize that customers are the reason you have a business or maybe they don't need customers. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere because they surely don't appreciate it. The rude and very nonchalant way of addressing customers doesn't mix well with high prices. Things have changed especially now when you can order on line and get exceptional service for a fraction of the cost.",

Businesses were clearly unprepared for the turnout this year, which still wasn't equivalent to last Halloween at all.  Whoever puts the event together should make sure that the businesses participating are educated on expectations,or advertise that the event will only last 30 minutes, which obviously won't bring in a great deal of patronage.

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that I have not provided Aloha nails any business for at least the last 2 years. I began to notice that their service was steadily declining and time and time again I would be disappointed with the results. The nail techs seem to be rushing and over-worked which led to poor quality nails. I was always respectful and still tipped the full amount because I knew that it was not their fault they were under-staffed but an issue with management. At least they were nice and seemed to be trying. \n\nWhen visiting with my mom recently, she told me of how she had gone to Aloha nails for a gel manicure and the horrible experience that she endured. She received the gel manicure with a man who was extremely rude to her. He constantly pulled on her arm and upsettingly would ask her to relax her arms and fingers although she wasn't trying to be stiff. The man yelled at her to stop looking at him work because that was causing her to be tense. My mom even tried helping and said that she would look away in hopes of making the guy feel she was more relaxed. The nail tech was huffing and puffing the entire time signifying he was upset and after all of that, my mom's nails were not what she was expecting. The gel came out very thick and uneven. It should have been taken into consideration that my mother is an older woman and trembling of the hands is something that cannot always be controlled and is fairly common within the older generation. This man could've been nicer and more empathetic. My mother was extremely embarrassed and even when telling the story I could tell how uncomfortable she must've felt. I'm sorry that I wasn't with my mom at the time and would've told that man to get away from my mother and walked out and never looked back. My mom didn't deserve to feel this way. \n\nI was not with my mom at the time so I can't say that I know all of the facts but after reading other reviews, I 100% believe that my mom wasn't exagerating. I will never return here and neither will any of my family or friends and I hope readers will take this into consideration when referring friends or family and especially their mothers.",

    "text": "You must forgive me if I start gushing and squealing like a school girl; my charming companion and I are in love with Carnivale and collect Venetian masks. In short, this place was heaven to us. \n\nMy personal bias aside, this place can only be described as amazing and elegant. Appropriately located off the canals in the Grand Canal Shoppes in the Venetian, you can browse masquerade masks while hearing gondoliers singing in the background. And mind you, these are not cheap knock-offs made from plastic like you find at local Halloween boutiques; these are are the real deal. Made by hand in Venice in the traditional style from papier-mâché, each mask is a one of a kind piece of art. From Bautas, to Voltos, to Medico Della Pestes (plague doctors), they carry a large variety of fine masks. \n\nDuring our recent trip to Las Vegas, staying in the Venetian during their Carnivale celebrations, we visited this shop several times trying to decide what we wanted to take home with us (it was an unspoken conclusion that we would both bring home a mask or two). In the end, we bought five masks between the two of us. The staff were exceedingly friendly and took very good care to wrap and pack the masks to keep them safe during our flight home, all the while bantering with each other and chatting with us. They clearly cared about what they did and made the experience more enjoyable. \n\nPrices here are not for the faint of heart, however, but are rather reasonable when you consider these are Venetian imports and hand made works of art. Masks can go between roughly $50 and 800$. More advanced pieces will go higher. You can come away with a good full faced mask for $75 and $300 depending on how elaborate a piece you are looking for. The five masks we walked away with set us back over $700. Were they worth it? Absolutely. \n\nIf you happen to be looking for an elaborate costume or fancy headpiece . . . expect these to go for a few grand. \n\nShopping here was a joy, and we adore what we came away with. We know when we come back to Vegas we are going to be making a few more purchases. \n\nOne last thing I feel compelled to say in response to commentary from other reviewers about Il Prato's \"No Photos\" policy is . . . stop and think about it. This shop sits in the middle of a high-traffic tourist attraction filled with clumsy oafs tripping over each other taking pictures of every little with their iPhones. If a mask shop allowed photos, every tourist and their child would be coming in and taking up room to pose for Facebook pictures in their expensive and fragile masks. Of course they don't want that. \n\nOnce again, this Il Prato was outstanding.",

Some of the holes in the mini-golf have nothing to catch the balls, they fall about a foot and a half down a hole. The bumper boats engines fail pretty often, forcing the disgruntled attendant to ride on his boat out there to give you a restart. The food is expensive and is of subpar quality. The fumes from the go karts and bumper boats are bothersome. All that said, I did have a tremendously fun time. I'm no longer a teenager and was skeptical as to how much fun I could have here, but despite all the flaws I spent about 4 hours in the park. About 2 hours longer than I had anticipated. The go karts go a pretty good speed and the track they run on is entertaining to drive on. Bumper boats are fun, but I would caution you that there is a waterfall present so it would be wise to leave your phone with someone safe before starting. All in all, the go karts and bumper boats carry this facility and make it an entertaining place to spend 4 hours. Would recommend checking out coupons beforehand, and I'd highly recommend the 4 hour unlimited ride pass!",

I complained (first they lied and said she'd get back to me that day but when I called back later I was told she had the day off) that it was a doctors office and a day off for a nurse practitioner shouldn't stop everything. They refused to give me pain medication because they didn't believe I was in pain. I chose to see an ENT the next day who said he would have never put me on antibiotics (they put me on 2) and yes I have pain because there was a cast on my eardrum that had to be sucked and scrapped off. They are so concerned about people drug seeking they they never thought to find out why I was in so much pain because yes ear infections aren't that painful so obviously something was really wrong and maybe try listening to the patient and if you don't know what you are doing which she didn't just refer me to a specialist in the first place.",

You tell them 4/10 on another day they give you a 8/10.  Never again because they obviously don't give a hoot about your tolerance.

    "text": "I had Shawna do my hair a few weeks ago. I had partial highlights and a haircut. Everyone was very nice when I got there. The salon was a bit dirty but they also have white chairs so I told myself not to judge so harshly. But as I sat there for hours getting my hair done I can't help but say it really does need a good scrub. \n  Shawna dropped a comb on the floor and picked it up and used it gross! But again it was already done so what could I say really. \n  Once the highlights were done and my hair was washed my ears were full of water. I had no towel to use since she left them at the sink. I purposely wiped my ears several times in front of her to see if she'd offer a towel. Nope had to ask and got a wet towel handed to me to use that was left on my lap for my hair cut. My hair cut took so long that my hair dried twice. I showed Shawna pictures, explained in detail how I wanted it and showed her a coworker with the hair cut I wanted. Well needless to say I walked out of the salon with my entire right side of my head an inch shorter than the left. I had asked for an A line bob and left with a hot mess. \n  My highlights were great she did do a good job there and the owner while I was paying  came up to me and said your highlights looked great. I agreed and waited for him to ask about my haircut but he never did. \n  When I left I had no idea it was as bad as it was I just thought it was longer than I wanted and was probably curling up funny from the blow dry. I have NEVER had a hair dresser cut my hair this uneven and never would've expected a professional to let me leave like this. Needless to say since the owner didn't say anything and Shawna let me leave this way saying to come back next week if it was still to long. I had no confidence that she could cut my hair correctly. \n  So I felt the only way to get the hair cut I had wanted and paid for was to go to another salon and pay again for the correct one. Thank god I did cause I had no problems at the new salon and was able to communicate easily the exact same way I did with Shawna to the new hairdresser and got the perfect cut   I paid $155 to have Shawna give my partial highlights and a lopsided haircut. I would not recommend going here.",

If I go to Newdle Bar, it's only on a Tuesday for half-priced sushi, because I'm not a fan of anything else on the menu. Prepare for a long long long long long wait, and waiters that couldn't care less. Avoid the white tuna, it's not as good as other places, like Phoenix Express in Stow. The Philadelphia roll is great, but only at half price rates. The online menu prices are also wrong, and are higher inside the restaurant. The atmosphere is loud, so don't expect to have intimate conversations with your dining Partner. Ross overall the place is good for a long dinner and some sushi. Many people have mixed experiences but that has been mine.",

And I have never regretted that decision!  The entire staff is extremely friendly and you can tell that everyone is happy to be there.\nMy most recent visit was several weeks ago for a hair styling appointment with Amerah, who is relatively new to Salon Sanctuary, and she did an absolutely magnificent job!  I went in with a pretty vague idea of what I wanted and she was very patient as we discussed several possibilities for my hair cut.  And she definitely does not disappoint!  She gave me a hairstyle beyond what I ever imagined.  I love how she is so thorough and encourages you to make sure everything looks the way you want it.  I will definitely be returning to her next time I make an appointment.\nOverall, I always have a wonderful experience any time I visit and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a friendly, high-quality salon.",

    "text": "Right in so many ways. I was hoping for good eats, but wasn't 100% sure what to expect. What I got was a complete treat for all my senses. \n\nWe went for Sunday brunch, and when I walked in, I did think, \"Man, this place is loud,\" but when I saw a live DJ in the corner, I couldn't help but smile. The entire vibe makes you feel like ish is happening here every day. The interior is just perfect with concrete floors, spring-like colors and an open kitchen for you to witness the creation of your eats. We ate at the counter and loved it. \n\nService was a little aloof, but I was too distracted by all the tattoos to really care. I think they just really mean business. \n\nThe menu itself is a work of art worth reading down to every last bite. The dishes are creative and well-thought out. You know there is a real love of food just by reading the possibilities. We ordered the Huevos Motulenos, Turkey Benedict (only available during weekend brunch) and a short stack of pancakes ($5!!). The Motulenos features a mind-dizzying array of ingredients, including sauteed bananas! Mixed in with two chilis and a variety of beans, it turned out to be a delicious dish of sweet and spicy. And, the breakfast potatoes were legit. Basically, chop up a potato and make it sizzle. A true tater. The Benedict with turkey bacon and spinach was also a winning combination of flavors. I swear I tasted basil, but whatever I tasted, I approve. The only slight complaint there was that it came out lukewarm. \n\nNow, the pancakes deserve their own paragraph, but can be best summarized with one word: perfect! They managed to have crispy, but not burnt, edges and a soft, milky center. They were the perfect thinness, making it all too easy to devour a short stack all by your lonesome. \n\nWorth noting: While the weekday menu includes tofu scramble and a tofu banh mi, I didn't notice any vegan options on the brunch menu. Might be worth calling if you're a vegan headed there for a weekend brunch.  \n\nMy only other minor complaint is that I thought the coffee was a little weak. However, that in no way prevents me from respecting this culinary gem. It's just so cool, a true Vegas original.",

That fear was completely unwarranted and there are attendees at all stages of their fitness journey here, and everyone was friendly.\n\nThe obvious perks for attendees are the freebies and the opportunity to meet pros you've only seen on TV or followed on IG- and they're typically enthusiastic about talking to and meeting fans, and taking photos, which was cool to see. There are many brands present to try new supplements, pre-workouts, or BCAAs, or just to stock up on your usual stuff with a discount (and no shipping fees!), along with some apparel brands and fitness publications (M&F is a sponsor). The freebies alone more than make up your ticket cost ($30/day or $50/weekend). If shopping and samples aren't your thing, try your hand at one of the many competitions- or just watch!\n\nMore than anything else though, it's fascinating people watching and a weirdly energizing atmosphere- I'm tempted to make a Bingo card for next year to catch all of the bizarre photo ops, long mens room lines, women in stage makeup and tans, random mascots, and the insane amount of implants and accents. \n\nTIP: Go early to avoid crowds and experience short lines, but stay late to get the lowest price deals.

Jazmin took the time to meet with me weeks before my wedding to help me finalize details and make sure my day ran smoothly. During our meeting she paid very close attention to detail and took notes. Her calm demeanor and \"I got this\" attitude is what eased my mind and made me feel better about the wedding planning process. On the day of my wedding Jazmin and Vince did an amazing job of coordinating our ceremony and making it stress free and fun! I would highly recommend this dynamic duo! \n-Brianna and Javier Hernandez",

Its probably not a good place for a first date, because you can expect to wait about 45 minutes to an hour to get a table, and another 30 to 45 minutes for your food (if you get their Chicago style crust) however, it is totally worth it if you enjoy the company of those you go with. Their pizza is wonderful, and a trip to Oregano's is simply incomplete without a pizzoki. If you enjoy drinks, their peach belini is great as well. I've never had something from Oregano's that I wouldn't advise someone else to order.",

    "text": "(Part 1 of 2)\n\nI looked upon our dinner at Giada De Laurentiis' new signature restaurant with much anticipation, people call weeks if not months in advance for reservations. We asked for window seating in order to see the Bellagio fountains and I forgot to slip the hostess a little extra dinero to get the optimum view.  The six of us were snuggled up cozy in a booth that would ordinarily swallow up two patrons, but still close enough to the action to see what was going on.  It was mild enough that evening to open the windows and show off their \"al fresco\" feature but I doubt that anyone would expect the piercing shrill of a passing emergency vehicle's siren to be so loud...\n\nThe cocktails seem to be on the colorful fruity side named after films in association with Giada's grandfather Dino De Laurentiis, not that the films were whimsical but only the drinks association with them, and maybe the iPads showcasing them.  I ordered a non-alcoholic Arnold Palmer that came along with its own pitcher, very stylish indeed.  In fact, there is no shortage of Giada's personal touches and branding throughout, even the hand towels in the restrooms felt lux, but it is her comfortable, more casual style that really comes out which also distinguishes the restaurant from places like Thomas Kellar's Bouchon, or Guy Savoy's eponymous restaurant at Caesar's...\n\nIt's nice to have six people instead of only two, that way you can share (steal) more things from your dinner guests.  Two people went for the four course nightly prix fixe and the other four merely obliged by ordering four individual courses a la carte.  The prix fixe is $120 per person and it comes with an autographed picture and recipes in a nice portfolio.  The bread service is fancy but I didn't think it was overly ostentatious;  try the Rosemary Focaccia, it's like cornbread...\n\nAppetizers:\n- Orzo Meatballs;\n- Frito Misto Shrimp & Calamari;\n- Bacon Wrapped Dates;\n- Peppers & Goat Cheese;\n- Ahi Crostini;\n- Prosciutto;\n- Wood Roasted Mushrooms;\n\nNo losers here but the meatballs are really good and are the only really must haves because they are the most uniquely Giada dish from this list.  The dates are good too but when dates are in season I've seen them elsewhere.  The fried squid, prosciutto, and peppers are not as interesting and more on the pedestrian side.  The Ahi Crostini may have been off menu just for the prix fixe, it was interesting with the inclusion of a sliced gherkin for a touch of sweet/sour taste;  the mushrooms are earthy with umami flavor but seem more appropriate as a side...\n\nIn-between courses they served us complementary aperitivo.  I don't remember what it was, I don't think its Campari since that's usually red tinged and this was clear;  reminded me of gin...\n\nPasta:\n- Lobster Ravioli;\n- Crab & Scallop Risotto;\n- Shrimp Lemon Spaghetti;\n\nThe two prix fixes came with the spaghetti, so we balanced the table out with two orders each of the ravioli and the risotto.  I was so glad that everyone at the table had a formal pasta course, it allowed us to share one of the strongest points of Giada's: the fresh pasta.  The shrimp spaghetti is uber rich with copious amounts of cream and butter with lemon zest.  The colossal shrimp might even be UT-6 count. Not to be outdone is the crab and scallop risotto with a pair of marshmallow sized scallop.  The crab presence is not lost to the scallop and there are even asparagus.  Again, there is a generous amount of EVOO and butter.  The lobster ravioli would be right up there with the spaghetti and the risotto if there weren't a couple of ravioli that had lobster shells in them...\n\n(End of Part 1)",

I am originally from Las Vegas and very familiar with the restaurants high level of customer service and have had incredible meals at haakasan in the past, so I was of course disappointed this ended weakly.  \nI made the reservation for 7.15pm through Takoda, who has made my reservations in the past .  He is always a pleasure to work with and answers promptly .  We were greeted by a couple very sweet and beautiful hostesses and actually decided to sit at the bar and have a more causal dinner that way.  The bar was completely empty, score right ? The bartender was cool and helped us out right away .  We ordered a cocktail , Budda's Palm ($22 cocktail!) which was amazing as usual then we ordered food ... Food came out quick ! The ribeye stir fry was so delicious and melted in your mouth!! We had a small bite , bacon, bean something roll , which was great at first bite ... The second bite I had was surprisingly crunchy, so much so , I couldn't actually bite through the green bean, odd right ? Well of course it was difficult as it wasn't a bean at all , it was a toothpick !!! I would have mentioned it to the bartender ; however , she was gone and the other 2 behind the bar were conversing.  Our bartender pretty much disappeared after that and the other bartender was focusing on another couple... 10 minutes later he finally comes over and we order dessert, chocolate mint and espresso .. Cake comes out no espresso no bartender .  The service started out strong but ended so weak and on top of that I had a toothpick baked into my very expensive small dish! Bummed out !",

Service at the front desk was fast, friendly and efficient. The lobby decor is ok. Nothing super fancy but nothing terrible either. \n\nWe were given  a room on the \"concierge\" floor. I have no idea what that means and frankly I don't think our room was better than anyone else's. It seems like that title is simply a gimmick to make gold and platinum members feel like they are being taken care of. \n\nRooms are in need of remodeling...or maybe they are just not decorated in my style. I dunno...the rooms seemed outdated. There was no safe, which was extremely disappointing. You can lock your things in a box at the front desk but they can't accommodate computers or purses. \n\nWe had an incident where we had a dirty bed. The situation was immediately rectified by the manager and he was genuinely concerned about the issue. He fixed it and made sure that others were aware of the situation so it would not happen again to us or any other guest. I appreciated that. \n\nFortunately we are gold members so we got fee wi-fi but there is a $9.95 charge if you are not. We were also given tickets to the breakfast buffet which was very good. Service in the dining room was great. \n\nOverall, I likely would not stay here again. It just was not that great.",

Not that waiting is an issue with Oyster Bar...waiting is just a necessary prelude for a dynamic finale, namely the food.  Any wait time for good food is excusable.  It's better to wait for good food for an hour or two then to eat at an establishment that serves mediocrity.\n\nMy brother found this place on Yelp.  I really want to thank my brother and all the Yelpers that submitted honest reviews of this place to make us come here.  The food is simply...amazing!  Thanks everybody!  I really want to keep this place hush hush but seems like I'm too late, the word has already spread around Yelp that Oyster Bar is the real deal.  Surprise, surprise, we sat next to some Yelpers and people who came because of the Yelp reviews of Oyster Bar, today, during lunch.  It's a small world after all...\n\nFirst off, do yourself a favor and order the reasonably priced Fanny Bay oysters for $16.99.  It's hard to see that price for Fanny Bay anywhere else.  Secondly, as you're waiting for whatever delicious entree you ordered, munch on that awesome bread they gave you.  Ask for more bread for later to dip on your Palace Pan Roast ($22.99).  They offer you a heat level of 1 through 10.  Don't go showing off now!  A 7 is pretty hot already.  The cook and waiter told us stories of many people who couldn't handle a 10.  Don't be that guy!  We also had the Seafood Jambalaya ($23.99) at a level 6.  Just enough heat without losing the overall flavor.  In a nutshell, the food here is awesome, especially the Palace Pan Roast.  Most people usually lose when going to Las Vegas, don't you lose out by not coming to Oyster Bar!",

I'm VERY familiar with the process of how this transaction should've went and have to leave feedback on what could've been improved. For starters when I walked in there was no visible person to greet and direct the \"traffic\". I stood at the front kiosk for approximately 7-10 minutes before anybody came over to find out what I needed help with. I then noticed a young Hispanic women who was holding a tablet that was assisting another customer (ok so they did have somebody out there but who was the back-up) I observed 3 other personal banker's whom had no customers at their desk and began to wonder why they didn't feel the need to jump in? Finally I was acknowledged and signed in to see a banker. That wait was less than 5 minutes and got issued my temporary card.

The coleslaw was watery and tasteless, the mac and cheese was dry, mushy, and tasteless, the potato salad was definitely not homemade, the fries were soggy, and worst of all, the red velvet waffles were nothing more than a regular waffle with added red food color for $3.00 extra.

M&M World is FOUR FLOORS with different things to look at. You can get things from cups, towels, and bags. You can customize what you want on your M&Ms but it has to be appropriate with no sexual content or explicit language. My favorite portion was the wall of M&Ms where you can create your own bag. I got a mix of mint, pretzel and crispy M&Ms. It is pricey by the pound so be mindful on how much you pack. I think I paid almost $20 for a full bag of M&Ms. Hershey Chocolate World is across the street located in New York New York so it would be good to go to both if you have the time.",

There were about 10-15 dancers.  $30 to get in.  My diet coke was $10.  Yep.  Not a typo.  $10 for a diet coke.  My beer was the same price.  The service was AWFUL.  Our drinks were empty most of the time.  You have to go up this staircase to get to the men's section that feels like you are walking up the stairwell of a parking garage.  Super creepy.  The dancers are VERY aggressive.\nHowever, I gave the club 1-star (instead of maybe 2) because of \"the atm incident\".\nWhen I took out money from the atm, I was very surprised that there was no \"This machine is going to charge you $3.00 (or $7.00) to take out money.  Do you wish to continue?\"  Or something along those lines.  My girlfriend couldn't believe it, so she went and took out money, too.  No mention of any charge.  We thought it was great- the club just wanted to make it easy for us to spend money.  I ended up not spending any of the money I took out- because I couldn't find a stripper I wanted to spend money on.  That should have been the end of it.\nThen, we looked at our bank statements and saw the ATM did charge us.  ALOT.  For $200 they charged us $20.  (It turned out to be 10%).  I wouldn't have been so pissed off, if maybe someone had told us that's how much the charge was.  This wasn't a case of I was drunk and don't remember how much I spent.  I was dead sober- hadn't had a drink yet- when I took out that money, and the service was so bad, I only managed to get the two-drink minimum by the time we left.\nCalled my bank, called the club.  Of course, there's nothing I can do, but warn others.  I don't like being scammed, or taken advantage of.  If you don't either, don't go to this club.",

I'm feeling generous today, so I gave them a 2, because the room was nice and the manager, William, was nice (he was the only one).\n\nWe received the most horrible customer service from the hotel staff (from the front desk staff all the way up to management). Day 1, the woman who checked us in dropped our credit card down the hole behind the computer. It took 1.5 hours for maintenance to fish it out. The manager who came over during this ordeal blamed us for the incident and told us to just be patient, we'd get the card back eventually. At one point we were told to go to get lunch (difficult without a credit card) and when we asked if lunch would be comped due to the issue at check in, we were initially told NO because it was our fault that the check in lady dropped our credit card. We then declined to get lunch, and said we'd prefer to wait at the desk to get our credit card back. It was clear they wanted us to leave the check in desk (there was a line of people waiting), because they then did offer to comp our lunch. Regardless, we needed our credit card and were afraid that once we were no longer in their sight, they'd get busy and never get the credit card back to us. So we stayed put, and continued to wait as patiently as possible for them to get us our card back.\n\nDay 2, my mom slipped at the pool and hurt herself. When I went to get some ice for her, the life guard was amazingly nice. He was the only one. The manager he called over blamed us, AGAIN. He said that we should know that the pool deck was slippery from sunscreen being dripped on it. This happened at 9am, when it was cloudy out. I guess the other 4 people at the pool that morning had slathered on their sunscreen and dripped it everywhere? Did they not wash the deck the night before? And, really, if it's that big of a problem, they should have put a sign out \"Slippery when wet\". For the remainder of our vacation, my mom walked with a limp and couldn't navigate stairs-which for anyone who's been to Vegas before, knows is an essential skill to have if you ever want to cross the street! It was Day 4 before we received any follow up from Risk Management about this. While Risk Management was nice to us, the woman we spoke with the first person the entire vacation that was.\n\nNot once did we receive an apology from the staff for any of this. Not once did someone say, \"I'm so sorry that your vacation didn't turn out to be awesome.\" We weren't looking for monetary compensation (though we did get some). We stayed here because it's a beautiful hotel, and I'd read reviews about how nice everything was, but we received the worst service imaginable. The attitude of the managers and other staff, blaming us for everything, really put a bad taste in our mouths. A smile, an apology, and a kind word would have gone a long way.",

It was too late though, we had both already devoured our soups (the super delicious chicken enchilada soup) and salads (mine was the ensalada fiesta, his was the chicken gorgonzola salad). Either way, for two cups of soup, two salads, and two beers, I would not expect a $40 bill in rural Wisconsin. GIVE ME A BREAK. If not for the unreasonably steep prices, I'd have given this place four stars.

My food came out so late everyone was nearly done with their food. My husband told them he was missing his chicken and he received it after finishing his meal. Our servers switched during the meal and when asking for our bill they asked us if we had a bottle of wine (which we didn't). They also took away our heat lamp during our meal for another table. We asked that we keep it as it was cold and they said they would bring another which they weren't able to light. It seemed as if they knew they missed the mark when we left but in no way offers to come anything (even the chicken my husband didn't eat because it came out so late). The service was really poor and the food was not amazing. Maybe it is an okay place for a drink but don't waste your time on a meal.",

Tonight we had avocado egg rolls (not as good as Cheesecake Factory) and an individual sized hand tossed pizza. They let us do half BBQ chicken and half spicy meatball. Some places don't let you do half and half if there are two different sauce bases (which is ridiculous, but I appreciate it even more when they do it).  Both were good, but the best thing is that we got Happy Hour prices even though we showed up at around 7:15! Our waitress told us that if the game is still on (its Thursday night football), the HH prices continue. Sweet!",

Been here many times. The helpful and nice sales people are always changing- fast turnover. The store is well-stocked, organized, clean, and smells really good (you will smell it from a ways away, but it's not sneeze-inducing). The promotions (e-mail list, mailed coupons, specials like Buy 2 get 1 free, etc.) are inviting. But the star here is the twice-yearly sales- when prices are really low. I really like the True Blue spa products with catchy names like \"Be More Pacific\" (manoi balm- smells like paradise- we love anything that conjures up memories of Hawaii). I also really like the pump antibacterial soaps with scents to match their lotions (Moonlight Path, Japanese Cherry Blossom, etc.) and  others like Kitchen Lemon. For years, I stocked up on their products for gifts year-round (& the holidays for that matter) for my friends and family. Be sure to stop there after the hoidays. I also go to the outlet store in Primm/Stateline (about 4x year).",

We were seated quite quickly and was surprised that there were S, L and XL pho options. Both my boyfriend and I ordered the #1, I ordered the large, while my boyfriend ordered the XL bowl. The XL bowl is priced at 9 CAD, which is about the standard price for a large sized bowl in NYC. \n\nWhen the XL bowl arrived, I was amazed. It was gigantic! The broth was delicious and the servings were decent, although there was a lot more noodles then I would have preferred. \n\nOn our last day in Toronto with only about 10 CAD each to spare, we headed back here and it was also, a good experience, but a lot more crowded. \n\nThe seating is pretty packed, but if you're looking for a quick and tasty bite to eat, check out Pho Hung.",

I called to make reservations in the morning and wasn't able to get in until 8pm (fine by me). First off, the bread was delicious (came with 2 types of butters). For appetizer, we had the carpaccio-it was a full plate of it with pieces of toasted bread on top! For the entree, we both had filet mignon. Mine came with the Fleming's potatoes (A MUST TRY). His came with crab stuffed shrimp and asparagus. For dessert we ordered the chocolate lava cake! OMG this was sooo good. I'm so glad we ordered this and it definitely satisfied my sweet tooth!! This place also has a large wine list--bottle prices were from  the $30's to $600's. If you don't finish it, they cork it and seal it in a bag for you to take home. Because it was my boyfriend's birthday, the manager gave him a $25 giftcard for next time. In addition, every staff member we talked to said happy birthday to him (I mentioned it was his birthday when I made the reservation over the phone). Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable on the food & wine as well. What amazing service and staff! The only negative thing for me would be the noise-but it was only because it was so busy!\n\nOverall, this place is worth every penny! Thank you Fleming's...we will be back again!",

    "text": "We had our car oil changed at this location at the endof august. The same day after the service, we started hearing an intermittent dragging sound coming from under the car. We thought we had just driven over some junk on the road and it was making the tire sound weird. A few days later, the splash guard under the front of our car came down almost totally while my spouse was driving to work. We had a mechanic friend take it down fully - he said that there were multiple screws missing and the tabs weren't inserted properly to hold it up. The piece is now ruined from dragging and we have to spend $250 at the dealership to get it replaced. We can't prove it was the oil change that did it, but given the timing, it seems highly likely that the technician didn't replace that splash guard properly when they did our oil change. The kicker? Our mechanic friend who helped us take the splash guard down when it was dragging said that the exact same thing had happened to him on two different cars at the same location we went to. Our car has less than 15,000 miles on it, so it definitely wasn't normal wear and tear. What was a cheap and easy oil change has turned into hundreds of dollars and frustration of time off work, etc. Avoid this location at all costs.",

The scenery is the highlight of this establishment.\n\nInterior of the banquet hall was modern and beautiful. Bathrooms were clean and had mouthwash and lotion- typical fancy amenities. \n\nFood was okay. We got a three course meal. Garden salad, steak and salmon, creme brûlée and cake. Salad wasn't anything special, no dressing just some walnuts and strawberries. Steak was a bit overcooked. Salmon was okay but lacked flavor. Best part was the dessert. Creme brûlée was my favorite and I would highly recommend it for anyone who decides to do an event here. They also served an odd red velvet cake which was uneven, some parts were salty and others were sour (I don't know if that was a Canadian thing). \n\nService was okay. Everyone was accommodating but they were understaffed. Had to wait a while to get orders in.\n\nOverall, you really pay for the scenery at this place. The food was pretty mediocre but you get to take some awesome pictures",

They did get busy later, but I felt they didn't care much about our comfort since they knew the rush was coming.  Ehh.  Back to the food.  It was really delicious!!  My son's pancakes were SLAMMIN and I had chilaquiles.  Red sauce was different, but still good.  No espresso, but had coffee instead and it was ok (not my style but the waitress said it was good and strong).  We all loved our meals.  Our meal was pricey so heads up!  My son's apple juice was $4!  If you're prepared with the cost, the wait or small table, then you'll be able to better enjoy the service and great food.    Great find in downtown vegas, I'll be back!!",

    "text": "Edible Arrangements seems to be unaware they are working with food. We have had two bad experiences with no satisfactory resolution from the company. In short, avoid this service and buy flowers. Here's the long version:\n\nExperience #1: I ordered an arrangement for my wife on the morning of her birthday. After placing the delivery order online I called in to ask for an approximate delivery time. They told me they can't provide estimates. So I asked what would happen if my wife wasn't there when they delivered, which was going to be fairly likely if it was before 4:00. They told me it would likely be later so it shouldn't be an issue. When I got home around 5:00 there was nothing there so I called in. They claimed to have tried twice to deliver, even tried neighbors (see next experience) but had to bring the order back to the store. So I had to drive over to the store to pick it up. I asked for a refund of the very high delivery fee but they refused even though I did everything I could to avoid the situation that took place. I went home noticeably unhappy with my \"fresh\" fruit arrangement.\n\nExperience #2: Despite refusing to use EA again, a family member sent us an arrangement two days ago. Again, they showed up in the middle of the day when no one was home. Then they tried the neighbors who were home this time. Unfortunately, after over 24 hours we still didn't have our arrangement. Maybe the neighbors ate it? Or maybe it's in their fridge still. Who knows, EA certainly doesn't, even though they entrusted these strangers with the delivery, and quality, of their product. We called back in and told them about our still-missing arrangement and they basically told us tough luck, it's our policy to leave it with the neighbors. The policy of a food delivery company is to leave \"fresh\" food with a stranger? We don't know if they're storing it properly. We barely know these people other than a friendly hello once in a while. And given that almost 24 hours had passed, why do we still want it? We asked EA to refund the sender but they refused. They finally agreed to send a new one but it's hardly a good resolution when we had to argue about it. The sender called the EA head office and was informed that leaving the delivery with neighbors is no longer their policy and hasn't been for a long time, guess this shawnessy location didn't get the memo. It is now 48 hours later and we haven't heard from the neighbors. \n\nIf EA wants to ensure quality and satisfaction, they should allow for some selection around delivery times. Better yet, hire a delivery person for the hours that people are typically at home instead of delivering when people are at work or school. Or accept that the ridiculously high delivery fee should cover for these issues instead of completely ignoring customer complaints.",

    "text": "My wife and I moved into a new, semi-custom home with a pool in late November of 1997. Although we were recently retired (i.e., retired at age 50), this was our first pool. We didn't realize that it was akin to adopting and raising a child - been there, done that. My wife and I are both engineers and at first, had no problem with performing the weekly maintenance. After about 5 years, key elements of the pool's waterworks begin to wear out as did our enthusiasm for the \"care and feeding\" of a big hole full of water in our backyard. This is when we got lucky and discovered Splash Pools and Scott Thomas.\n \nOver the years we've engaged Scott and his crew to perform a number of major tasks pertaining to the pool - draining and acid washing, replacing bulbs in underwater lights and maintaining a somewhat complex automated cleaning system. We've never regretted this choice. The work has always been performed in a professional and timely manner at a fair price.\n \nOur pool celebrated its 16th birthday last year, and we decided in early summer to replace all of the equipment (electrical panel, pumps, filters, heater, actuator valves, blowers, and control system) with \"state of the art\" hardware. Elements of our old system were wearing out and selective replacement and repair was proving to be less than cost effective. Also, we wanted to take advantage of sophisticated, Wi-Fi based controls and multi-speed, energy efficient  pumps.  The project took about three weeks and is now complete - we couldn't be happier. If you are considering any mechanical and/or electrical work for your pool, give Splash Pool an opportunity to bid the job. I think you'll be happy with the results.",

I can't think of anywhere else in Toronto I've eaten this fabulously at this price point, other than the doubles at Caribbean Roti Palace. We feasted on the chicken adobo, which was four pieces of pure heaven. I could have eaten fourteen. The Shanghai lumpia (6) were delicious, came with a great vinegary dipping sauce, and were very generously portioned for a $6 appetizer. The pancit came with a precious little yellow-green calamansi lime sliced in half to squeeze on top. We got more chicken on top, which melted in my mouth a lot like the adobo had. The noodles and toppings were a bit fancier than what I've made at home, tossed with artful sprigs of greens and long strips of lightly charred cabbage. It had all the crunch, rich oiliness, and tang that you hope for in great pancit. With tax and tip we paid $20 each for a lot of food. \n\nEven the little things were great - a bowl of garlic rice we tacked on as a side dish was so, so garlicky in the best way, and quite large. \n\nI am already strategizing excuses to come up to St. Clair to eat here repeatedly.

I understand why people will wait -sometimes up to 3 hours - for their favorite dish.  \n\nI had the combo pan roast, which consisted of lots of crab meat, shrimp, and large chunks of lobster. The soup base was one of the best tomato bisque soups I've had. It's served with a scoop of rice and sourdough bread.  I had a spicy level 5 which was perfect. \n\nI tasted the gumbo, which hubby ordered.  Different flavor profile from mine, but packed with a lot of strong flavors. He ate it all up and said he would order it again.\n\nMy friend had the  bouillabaisse, which I loved, except she ordered a spicy level 8 which I couldn't handle. She even regretted it too, saying the temperature heat and spicy heat was more than she is typically use to.\n\nMy advice for this place: (1) come at least 2 hours before prime lunch or dinner times start. Your wait might only be an hour - an hour and one half (I arrived at10:30am, and was seated at 11:45am); (2) try not to come with a large group (4-5 max) because with only a few seats at the bar, it will take a while for a large group to be seated; (3) be careful not to order your soups with more than a level 5 spice (they use red cracked pepper and habeneros as their spices), and (4) don't waste your time or money on their oysters.\n\nOverall great food and service. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "Greetings,\n  I have been working on my dream pool project now for the last 2 years and have to say where other pool builders would literally walk away with no further communication, Tribal Waters took on the challenge and has been exceptional in many ways.\nI have learned a great deal about the Pool process -- and perhaps many take it the wrong way as it is not \"cookie cutter\"  or even as traditional as building a house -- there is a great deal of decisions.   Unless these are really discussed and confimed, it can lead to dis-satisfaction.  Over the years, I have seen the various trades/sub crafts move in/out of Tribal, so that is something that is central to all business processes -- including home building, where you have work that needs to be done by a given specialist -- and different levels of abilities.  \n\nAnd unlike other contractors -- they have been fantastic to correct any/all problems with equipment or issues that arise.  This is something that many other trades, simply do not do.\n\n Tribal Waters focuses on custom jobs and remodels -- they have been wonderful at bringing my ultimate dream to light -- It is the World's FIRST EVER SOLAR POWERED SURF PARK.\n\n  Yes, literally, I surf in my backyard, and with the updates in the coming months, I will be able to handle up to 225 lbs per person.  Enclosed are some pictures - AND  Google the following:\n  \"  Surfing Middle Desert\"   [the first version done 2 years ago]\n or feel free to ask more questions of me, directly. \n\n Sure, it might be cheaper to fly/Drive to San Diego, but now, with the swipe of my fingers on my smartphone, I can surf in my backyard, with a nearly zero electric bill, year round, and share this experience with my clients and friends.  The pool itself looks beautiful with numerous fountains and waterfalls, even at night, rivaling Las Vegas!  \n\nUltimately-- instead of a dirt backyard or simple kidney pool, Tribal Waters has enabled me to come home to a resort experience that rivals the best destinations in the world.\n\nWill update more when I finish the project this year!",

    "text": "DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT ever go to any Western Dental office for orthodontia or dental treatment.  I had braces put on in like 2012 or so, and I had dental coverage with  $5,000.00 of orthodontia coverage for which I paid extra, through work.  I signed a contract that showed what my portion of the bill would be, and what my insurance coverage would pay.  I paid my portion of the bill every month, using either my debit card or my healthcare spending account.  Midway through the process, I asked the billing office why it showed my insurance hadn't paid anything, and was told they paid at the end of each year, and then paid the final amount, at the end of treatment or, at the end of the second year.  Mid treatment, my dental provider changed, when we signed up for benefits each year through my employer.  The coverage, however, did not change, and there was no lapse in coverage.  I, then, changed jobs, and provided my new information to the office.  That has now been over two years ago.  When I was last in the office, in July 2015, I purchase a retainer, paid $98 for it, and got the bill. The bill still showed that I owed about $200 for my end of the balance, and that the insurance company, after all this time, still hadn't paid anything towards their part of the bill.  I spoke with somebody again, after discussing this with them on multiple occasions, and explained that no payment had been paid.  I called my ex-employer and found out that nobody had ever billed the insurance company for the orthodontia services.  When I asked about it, the dental office told me that I was marked as being \"self pay.\"  If that was the case, why does the bill show a portion still due from my insurance company, and why do I have a contract showing what my portion of the bill would be, and  also showing insurance responsibility?  I tried to explain this to them.  They didn't quite get it.  When I finally got ahold of somebody who understood what I was saying, they tried to bill my insurance company again, almost 16 months after the fact.  The insurance company will pay claims submitted up to a year late, so they denied the claim.  I've explained this to Western Dental multiple times... And explained that they did not submit the claim in a timely manner, and that, because of their failure to do so, they didn't get paid.  After discussing this with them several times, over and over again, and spending hours and hours on the phone with them, they said they would look into it, and call me back.  I never heard a thing back from them since July of last year.  No billing statement.  No calls.  Nothing.  I assumed that, after a year, they'd caught their mistake, and that they'd simply written it off.  Nope.  I called to get a receipt for the retainer I'd bought back in July of last year,  and found out my account had been sent to collections for the entire amount my insurance never paid.  To top it off, the office, when it submitted the bill some 16 months late, billed the insurance for the total cost of the bill which was over $5,500.00.  They not only billed late, but they over-billed as well.  Now, I'm sitting here with an account in collections, and Western Dental won't even discuss it with me.  The collection company wanted to offer me a settlement, allowing me to pay a smaller amount, but I told them they could take me to court.  I confirmed, again, that I was covered, in every way, with the insurance company, and that the claim was submitted 16 or more months after the date of service.  I'm getting a lawyer.",

We arrived at the Cromwell and were greeted at Valet by the nicest Valets I have ever experienced in Vegas. We made our way upstairs to the hostess station at the restaurant and were told our table would be ready in a couple of minutes. To pass the time we went into the photo booth and took some photos to remember the day by. Just as we were done in the photo booth, our table was ready. The restaurant itself is large and very open. It is beautifully decorated with huge movie posters of movies that Dino De Laurentiis produced in his amazing career. Next time we go however we will try to get a seat by the window as it is an amazing view. But enough of the stuff no one cares about, lets get to the food. \n\nWe had the wood roasted mushrooms, the baby sweet peppers, the sweet ricotta pizza, and the muffuletta. We loved every single one of them. Basically this was one of the best overall meals I have had in a restaurant in a very long time. \n\nAlso the service was great and Giada herself was in the restaurant going to some tables and talking to them. Although we didn't get to meet her we love that she is there talking to her fans.",

The guy that did our nails was very nice however my cousin and i were not very pleased with the work. He started my cousins nails while i waited. There was a girl doing a pedicure on another client so i just sat there. When the girl was done she just sat there reading a magazine while i was still waiting. More people came in after us and they all got attended first.\n\nMy cousin got short white tip full set and they left the corner edges of the nails super sharp. You could also see so many tiny white bubbles on her nail beds. They charged her $45.\n\nAs of me i asked for almond full set. My nails came sooo thick, bumpy and poorly shaped. The nail polish job was horrible! My nails were longer and took more time and was charged $5 less then my cousin. \nI would not recommend this place.\n\nUPDATE:\nIts only been a week and i have lifting because he did my nails over my cuticles.",

They have a good selection of craft beer on tap featuring several local brews and they mix up a decent cocktail too. The prices are reasonable, not cheap but not overly expensive either. There is no happy hour and they really don't need one to draw people in. They have a pretty good following as is, mostly locals, mostly laid-back. I've never seen it get too rowdy even when the place was packed. The patio is a nice, spacious option, especially if it's smoky inside. If you hangout long enough there will eventually be a bum or two on the sidewalk. No big deal, they just add to the charm of this place. And, yes, it is quite charming.",

    "text": "I tried Empowering Punch for a month with my neighbor and a Groupon. It was nice to try something different. Although very intimidated at first, the staff are very gracious to help you feel at ease. What I appreciated most was that the instructors have an excellent gauge of each person's ability, and a great knack for meeting you where you are and challenging you just enough. During the boxing classes, everyone is divided into rotating groups. While you are in the ring, the instructor prompts you to throw certain punches by number. That's where the expertise comes in with challenging each person at his/her level. All of the classes are an amazing workout. I really liked the Kettlebells class. I think the Bosu Step was a bit beyond me; that one was really hard. It is a little weird when the old men Mall walkers occasionally stop to gawk. But, if you ignore that, it's not a big deal. The only down side that I experienced, beyond this type of exercise just not being my 'cup of tea', was the really stinky gloves. Each person sprays Lysol into the gloves after class, but they still leave your hands ultra-stencho pretty much for the remainder of the day. I would recommend buying your own gloves. The monthly cost was also a bit prohibitive for me, although not completely outrageous.",

    "text": "What a fantastic Cheeseburger Joint!!\n\nYou'd never expect to walk into a pink neon-lit 50's diner from the outside.  This restaurant is part of a new little center wtih a \"lodge\" theme - river rocks, the whole deal.  But once inside the door, you're back at the malt shop of your parent's teens.\n\nThe hostess sat us quickly on a Saturday afternoon and briefly explained the menu to us.  Burgers, fries, rings, salads and shakes - the menu isn't complex, but it's loaded with choices.  40-something flavors to mix and create your favorite combination of shake.  (I can't recommend the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana highly enough!)  The burgers are straightforward, just choose the size (quarter through full pound!) and choose your cheese and toppings.\n\nThe french fries and onion rings are absolutley amazing.  Fresh made right there, never frozen.  We ordered a full size \"half and half\" (fries and rings) and it was too much for the three of us.  The optional dipping suaces were really tasty too - we got cheese, habenaro jelly and creamy jalepeno.  (The spicy sounding ones were not as hot as you'd expect - just super yummy.)\n\nThey do to-go orders, and you can place your order over the internet.  Personally, I think this place is best suited for pulling up a chair and enjoying a fresh-made, juicy burger and a tall, creamy malt.  (I do mean juicy on the burgers - the rolls of paper towels on the table got used a lot by my brother and husband.)  Cheeburger Cheeburger will be our new favorite burger joint - a wonderful (and much cheaper) replacement for Burger Bar.  No, it's not as FAB-U-LOUS as Burger Bar (at Mandalay Place) but at half the cost, I'll happliy lose the opportunity for foie gras on my burger.\n\nOne note on the wait for your meal: the menu asks for patience as they make everything to order - so expect to wait about 15 minutes.  Honestly, between our milkshakes and the trivia cards on the table, the time went quickly.  And don't be afriad to be adventurous with your milkshake.  My brother's Reese's Pieces shake was a bit bland, so they happily added peanut butter and re-blended it when he asked.  Great service!!\n\nWe're looking forward to going back and trying new burger and shake combos!  (and OMG, more of those onion rings!)",

This seemed to awaken some sort of primal response in the barman who suddenly realized he had a job to do. We asked some questions about the beers he literally threw a menu at us and said \"you can read can't you?\" OK everyone has an off day so we ordered some appetizers and a flight. Surprisingly the food came before the beer! (Remember we were seated AT THE BAR). The place was nearly empty so again I got an idle waitresses to refill our waters which again awakened the barman who wordlessly shoved our appetizers aside and very rudely put our flight down and walked away. I called him back and asked him to explain the beer. He couldn't be bothered pointed to the menu and walked away. We were done. I left a twenty on the bar and walked out food uneaten and beer untouched. Interestingly not one staff person said a word to us.\n\nSo I'm a sucker for breweries. I went back, this time with my son, mid day on a Saturday again at the bar, different barman, no crowd, same ten minute wait for someone to catch my eye, this time we didn't bother to order.

I was surprised at the generous number of slices of gyro meat that were in her gyro and the fries were fresh cut and tasted as though they were fried in peanut oil.\nExceptional for a bar....er.... restaurant!  \nThe steak on my enormous salad was PERFECTLY  done, something that half the steak houses out there seem unable to execute.  \nThe salad greens were iceberg, but not from a \"Bag-o-lettuce\", with a generous amount of cucumber and tomato along with a fair amount of finely shredded colby cheese.  \nThey brew their iced tea, but had not yet done so for the day, so sodas around.\nService was spot on!\nThe waitress could walk by our booth at full speed, grab an empty cup without slowing one iota, and have it back filled in under 30 seconds!  \nAnd the empties never sat for long!  \nEven the water glasses which seem to become invisible to most waitstaff once they hit the table!\nWhere's my cloning machine when I need one?\nAlthough we didn't try them, they have  a \" one from column a one from column b\" luncheon combo selection with a nice variety in both columns for $6.99, guaranteed ready in 15 minutes on weekdays for the work-a-day crew.  \nBeats the begeesus out of\nany place sporting a drive-thru window for value, and one gets table service thrown in as well! \nThere are several locations..probably one near you....try 'em!\nWednesdays are $3.00 martini nights for the ladies.\nToo bad Halloween falls on Friday as a little trans-gender dressing might otherwise be on the table!",

I would prefer this because you can still hear the busyness and upbeat music inside the store and it's harder to relax.

I suppose we're supposed to be able to read the fine print as we're driving by. I can handle the sneaky advertising because it's how they reel people in, I get it. But, to top it with a very sarcastic, unprofessional customer service rep (Alex), it was a horrible experience. So far my car hasn't exploded so I guess they did the job correctly. But, trust me, I will NEVER go back and I'm telling everyone I know about my experience here.  Alex may have been having a bad day.  Alex may hate his job.  Alex may just be a jerk.

And SET we did, it took another 15 minutes to get bread and water. The SET we did again, our waiter apologized and when he walked up in broken english asked if we were ready? Ready oh yes by this time we had been there over 40 minutes.  We ordered pasta dishes and both were very acidic, the salads were not tossed, you get a small plate of lettuce and you are supposed to somehow toss the salad yourself on this small plate.  The pasta itself was cooked right. After they placed each thing on the table a woman who barely speaks english walks up and asks you if it is \"good\". The building itself is beautiful and even though they have gaming it is not smokey.  I just think they need better pasta sauces and better management. Obviously more or better servers as it was not busy but we kept waiting. In all we were there over 2 hours and we did not linger. We won't be giving it another try.",

    "text": "I got a good laugh out of reading the Yelp reviews for this \"business.\"  I thought I would recount my experience in the summer of 2013 just to add some additional information about what consumers can expect if they choose Payless Car Rental at the Las Vegas McCarran airport. \n\nThe day before I flew in to Las Vegas from San Diego I called Payless to reserve my rental car. My car got reserved and the price I was to going to pay was quoted and locked in with Payless over the phone (or so I thought). \n\nWhen I got to the airport's rental car area after getting off my flight I noticed that every car rental company's counter had a long line except Payless. I stepped up to their counter and gave the attendant my reservation information. He generated the paperwork and I noticed the price was around 50% higher than what Payless and I had agreed to on the phone less than 24 hours earlier. \n\n\"What they told you on the phone was just an estimate\" he told me. I held my ground and started going back and forth with him. I had Home Depot showing up at my condo in less than two hours to install a new carpet and I had to get my car and get out of there but without getting ripped-off.\n\nHe was holding his ground as well, and in order to wear me down he started asking me irrelevant questions of a personal nature, one of which was \"Why did you come to Las Vegas today?\" Here's how the rest of the exchange went:\n\nMe: \"I came to Las Vegas because I'm going to install new carpet in my condo.\"\n\nHim: \"Oh then you should call my friend Paul. He's runs a carpet business here in Vegas.\"\n\nMe: \"Really? That would be awesome. What is Paul's phone number?\"\n\nHim: \"[Gives me his friend's number]. Paul will take care of you. And I think we can get this rental car price down a ways for you too.\"\n\nThe price then went back down to about 5% higher than the price I had been quoted by the Payless person on the phone the day before. I carefully checked and signed the papers, grabbed the keys, and got the heck out of there, never to return to Payless Car Rental.",

The cafe has seating that lets you have a complete view of the casino, so people watching is a must. The menu does not have that many French options besides crepes; they have mostly steak and eggs, omelette dishes, etc.\n\nI had the eggs benedict ($17), which came with canadian bacon and potatoes. The potatoes were well seasoned, but could have been crispier. I'm not a huge fan of hollandaise sauce (all that butter, no thank you), so I wasn't pleased when my eggs were drowned in it. I loved how the English muffin tasted more like a biscuit, since it was dense and savory. Portions were really good and everyone was stuffed after leaving. We also shared a croissant, which wasn't anything special in my opinion and not worth $6.\n\nI didn't notice that my food was cold or that service was slow. The line to get in at 10 AM was about a ten minute wait. Price is a bit expensive, so if you wanted to eat at Paris, I would recommend the creperie.",

    "text": "Someone else said it best - this gym was amazing when it was Hard Candy, and has been through too many changes and had too many downgrades to be considered \"a great gym\" at this point. I almost joined the new LA Fitness in the Junction and ended up changing my mind because the limited amount of functional training equipment is kept behind a personal training barrier and the rest of the gym was extremely basic. So, after visiting HC/Aura a few times, I decided to go back last night and find out about memberships.\n\nNow it's Crunch Fitness. Their \"Premium membership\" includes scratchy, small towels that cover about 30% of my body (I'm 5'8) for a shower. Also includes their classes - most of which I like and are basically the only good thing left over from Hard Candy. You can get unlimited guest passes which is cool but doesn't really matter to me. Same annoying sign up fees that you see elsewhere - $90 initiation, $20 \"card fee\", and $70/month after that. I was a bit surprised at the cost and thought Aura's prices of $49 were much more reasonable. I was still considering joining because I LOVE the functional training area there, and love to use the heavy bag (I am an ex boxer), Free Motion equipment, box jump platforms, sled, etc. \n\nSo I walk by on the way to my class and I see a big sign posted saying \"NEW POLICY - functional training zone only to be used by personal trainers/clients between 4-8pm, Monday-Thursday\". MOTHER. F@#$@#^$@'s. So, the one area that I wanted to use and the only reason why I wanted to sign up, taken away completely as those are the exact hours that I would be exercising there. I am so frustrated with gyms in Toronto. Forcing you into basic memberships where you will probably stop going out of sheer boredom, or pay up the a%@ and get access to the beneficial parts of the gym. And still charging $70 per month while restricting access to the only part of the gym that would be worth that cost. So, I won't be going back.\n\nThey have also removed all of the products from the bathrooms, using some sort of cheap shampoo or soap (couldn't even tell what it was) that made my skin break out in hives.\n\nCrunch, thanks for killing the vibe.",

Our server Thompson, was Johnny on the spot with everything, while not being intrusive. One of the adults was just about to eat some food with his hands due to a dropped silverware by his son. When Thompson hands him some more without ever being asked, again awesome service. \nFood was all absolutely delicious, the filet mignon was about the only thing I didn't care for. My favorites were the flank steak followed by the house special with the garlic steak right behind it. As far as the salad bar, if you need a bigger one go find a sizzlers or souplantation.

Reasonable prices and possibly the best pierogies I've ever had in Pittsburgh, where pierogies are a tradition. Get the \"grandpa style\" with bacon and fried onions - you won't be disappointed (and they are made fresh in-house daily). My daughter ordered the grandma's mac and cheese. Despite a warning on the menu that it would take extra time, we were served within 20 minutes. They don't use microwaves or freezers in the restaurant - everything is freshly made. The crust on their pizzas is amazing, and my son loved his \"hula burger\" with pineapple and other toppings.

We got there at 9:30 and didn't actually get into the actual haunted house until 1145..yes, the wait was 2 hours and 15 min. We were all excited when we first got there and the line didn't seem too bad, they usually seem to go pretty fast and the line can be part of the fun in most cases, well not this one. This was way too long of a wait. They were letting each group go in separate by themselves whether it was a group of 2 or 6...I do like that each group gets to experience their own experience without a group of strangers with you, however in this case you just couldn't do that...everyone was getting frustrated from waiting. There was a VIP line which some people were getting out of the regular line and going to VIP. VIP saved you waiting time, but it didn't seem as quick or such special treatment. They still had to wait 15 maybe 20 minutes at the most. The haunted house itself was pretty good but It wasn't worth it for the wait. I heard the one actor who was walking around tell someone, you may have to wait longer but that means the quality of the scare is better. The actors in the haunted house were interactive. I wouldn't go back to Terror Town!",

My dad, who is the most meticulous human being alive and can spot a scratch on my car from a mile away, was absolutely amazed and could not even tell that there had ever been a dent there.\n\nTim and the guys truly know their business, cars, and what they're doing; when I picked my car up yesterday, a salesman from a nearby, reputable, dealership had brought in a brand new car to get a dent fixed on it's bumper, before putting it back on the lot- that's how good they are.\n\nOne last thing, ladies, something we've all fallen victim to before, these guys didn't try to price gauge me and convince me that I needed to replace the entire door, along with dozens of other adjustments (aforementioned body shop did- literally the guy told me it would cost extra money to replace the glue on the back of the silver trim that they would have to remove.)\n\nManpower has gained a family of customers for life and I still can't get over how amazing my car looks.",

I can over look that for so long, but yesterday I found a HAIR in the pico de gallo that was on the salsa bar by the register. The manager apologized and replaced the batch but it was too late. That hair was -deep- in there. Three people that were near me put their pico in the garbage after they saw the dyed reddish-brown hair I found in my pico.

    "text": "After my first visit last August, I immediately fell in love with this place.The food, the drinks, the wacky decor, the atmosphere, I had finally found my \"spot\". I have periodically frequented Krazy Fish since then and after each visit in the recent months I must say my opinion has changed dramatically. Although the atmosphere lately is anything but fun and upbeat and downright uncomfortable at times, I find myself returning for the simple fact that the food is always delicious. As for the drinks, I have to say it's hit or miss, most of the time it seems the person behind the bar is basically \"winging it\". They have a decent wine and beer selection and always have beer specials so I would recommend going that route considering it's hard to screw that up. The service has never been over the top great which I have to sum up to poor management and lots of yelling going on (even with a full dining room) and at times looks to be down right nasty. I have personally witnessed servers on the verge of tears which would explain new faces just about every time I have dined here. Such a shame that this place has so much potential but who wants to dine at a place where it seems that there is always some sort of turmoil brewing behind the scenes? I would definitely recommend the food, however, let me suggest you call in your order and eat it in the comfort of your own home so that you can fully enjoy your meal. The Salmon Tacos are the best and will not disappoint.",

After getting burned trying to buy a outback in California I reached out to these guys.  Kim was my sales person and Mike the sales Mgr. Great team you will not go wrong, look them up please.\n\nI got a better deal here than in California. I was initially looking at the Outback Limited and was dealing with this dealership and two others in California. After looking at the car in person I couldn't pull the trigger. Then I saw a Touring model someone had ordered. That was the car I wanted. Galpin Subaru had one, I gave them a deposit over the phone, 3 hrs later they sold it to someone else. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM.  I reached out to Mike and Kim again, I knew they had this same car. Mike offered me a great price, put a deposit down and flew out to get it 3 days later.  \n\nI cant not review on the service dept. but as for my buying experience it was great. If your looking for a great deal, a great salesperson, contact Kim at this Subaru dealership.\n\nThanks Again !!\n\nLinda",

    "text": "I have been an advocate of Banker Insulation since 2007 when they did some insulation work for my Garage in Surprise. Did a great job and couldn't be happier. In 2011, they did it again to our home in Goodyear. Great job again. Decided to use them at our business location in Goodyear, why wouldn't we. The actual job of removing the old insulation and installing the new looks great. But prior to the insulation job, we had the epoxy floors done so keeping them nice was critical. The sales manager suggested some boots for the lift so that the lift didn't cause issues with the floor. Sounds great to me. After the job was done, the floors were scraped and scratched and it did not look like either of the lifts had any boots on them. I do not know how they got scraped up, whether is what the lifts supports, staples on the floors and turning on them, I really don't care what did it. I just wanted them to be exactly how they were. Come to find out, that boots/diapers are for the bottom of the lifts, not for the tires, so that the lifts do not leak oil on the floors. That was not made known until after we were trying to come to problem solving answer. My $10,000+ epoxy floors don't look like $10,000+ floors any longer. They would rather say that it was not their fault when no one else is in the shop while they are working then keep a continued customer happy. $750 out of a $6000+ invoice, It is really sad. Am I an advocate now? I can't. If they come back and offer to fix the floor, I would say that they did the right thing and would become an advocate for them again.",

It was hot hot.",

If they cook you a wrong dish, your problem, or they will just remix the wrong dish with something else so that it looks like the dish you ordered, etc.\n\nThai dishes are really bad here, stick to the Vietnamese ones.\n\nI have tried: \n* appetizers: mostly good, if you know what you want. K10 has a ton of shrimp in it.\n* pho -- it is a bit above average for Toronto\n* Quail (K17) -- horrible\n* Rice with grilled meat (197 and such) -- tolerable\n* Stir fry (203-212) -- decent, but stick to beef/shrimp. Chicken is some fake substitute. \nBeef could be fake too, but it tastes better.\n* Pad thai -- big no. Go to PAI, Thai Princess, or Khao San Road instead for that.\n* Vermicelli dishes (B01-B28) -- below average for Toronto, but passable. \n\nOverall it is nothing special, and all the other options in the immediate vicinity are worse. \nSo it is quite popular for lunch, actually. \n\nBe careful and do not come when they open (10am), you might get leftovers from yesterday.",

The food is decent and the interior is nice, but the tables/diners seem to be squished elbow-to-elbow New York style. Spartan, but slightly upscale, this restaurant ALWAYS seems to have a wait.  \n\nThe yellow curry here is my favorite with a delicious balance of coconut, spice, carrots chicken and potatoes.  I can't ever seem to get enough, and I really mean that.  The portions here are small, and while lunch portions are expectedly small, portions elsewhere (at Chanpen Thai, for example) are larger and less expensive. Elsewhere the Thai BBQ chicken comes with 1/2 a chicken, but at Thai Basil they give you three lonely strips like cheapos!  The massaman curry and pad thai are pretty good too, but I feel they're just OK.  I've had better.\n\nService is hit or miss here.  One thing that's consistent: they always seem to be understaffed. Once when I was dining alone (at a 4-person table) they had the nerve to ask me to move while in the middle of eating, to a 2-person table. \n\nTo me, Thai Basil is style over substance.  Not impressed.  Next.",

    "text": "If you're a fan of Elvis, you'll probably like this show whether its good or not.  Its got everything you'd ever want in an Elvis show (and perhaps some things you don't want or understand, too).\n\nMy seats were in the front row of the balcony.  I have to admit I was concerned about being so far away and up high, but with the size of the stage and some of the set pieces, I was happy we sat where we did.  We could see everything from there.\n\nThe show is basically the life and times of Elvis, from his discovery to Vegas.  The Colonel guides us through from beginning to end, working the crowd before the show starts by getting them to dance or sing for an Elvis button or picture.  His mic went out a couple of times during this \"preview\" performance (shows put on before grand opening so they can work out the kinks).\n\nThe acts were varied from obvious choices to some weird stuff.  I could, for the most part, follow along even when it was a bit strange (i.e. realize what they were trying to get across), but I can see how a lot of people may not get the ideas being presented.  I have seen KA, O and Believe and Viva Elvis is within the vein of these shows but does make its own mark.  My friend said that Viva Elvis was not as good as LOVE (but he is a huge Beatles fan, too).\n\nI would still recommend going to see KA, O or a non-Cirque but Cirquey \"Le Reve\" before seeing Viva Elvis.  I did like Viva Elvis, a lot, but for the amount of money being spent on a ticket with the probability you'll be far away from the stage, you can get more bang for your buck with the better KA and O, or spend the same amount of money and be at the maximum 13 rows from stage/water in Le Reve.\n\nEither way, if you see any of these shows, you'll have a good time.",

To me, this makes Five Guys more of an occasional, intentional destination rather than a place I might frequent.    You can start to get a decent meal at a more comfortable place for about that same price -- Olive Garden for example.\n\nI know Five Guys isn't McDonald's, but I sure don't think they're better enough to charge about triple the price of McDonald's, or twice the price of In & Out burgers.",

Not only with the food, but also with the service and the servers.  Always greeted at the door, and our wait has been very short each time.  This place gets very busy, so do expect to wait for seating.\n\nThe only thing we order are the combo dishes.  For our group(s), it is always the way to go, and we have never left still hungry.  For us, the winner is Set 3.  The taste is always good, and like I mentioned consistent every time we have been.  We especially like the salt mixture that they provide.  The side dishes are ok.  For me, meh as far as taste.  It does seem very authentic though.  The dessert, if you have room, is a great ice cream/rice krispy sandwich.  It is light and just right to finish off the meal.  We always order rice bowls and extra sides that we do like, which are all free or included with the combos.  The large runs us $100 plus tip.\n\nThe one kinda cool, and at the same time odd thing, is that you can brush your teeth after the meal (in the restrooms.)

The other reviews all seemed to be very positive, so we stopped into Anise Cafe.\n\nIt is a very new restaurant, Dec 2010, very tastefully decorated and extremely clean.  We were greeted by the owner who was friendly and attentive although a bit disappointed that we only wanted Pho.  Water was served with an orange slice.  Nice touch.\n\nWe ordered the Pho with rare beef.  It was huge!  In California where we ate much Pho, this would be considered a 'large' and cost ~$2 more per bowl.  It was served traditionally with all of the veggies and sauces.  The broth was very flavorful and not greasy.  The noodles and beef were generous.  It was the first time we couldn't eat all of our Pho!\n\nThe only comment I have is that I prefer my rare beef sliced more thinly and set on the very top of the noodles so that I can eat it a little more easily and a little more rare if I please.  Not a complaint, just a note.\n\nWe will recommend Anise Cafe to our friends and return ourselves the next time we are in Phoenix.  Good job and good luck to the owners!",

    "text": "Excellent service and easy communication from start to finish! So glad I used Vegas club life to get my crew setup, so much easier than going back and forth trying to figure it all out on my own.\n\nI reached out and let them know that we were a group of 6 guys. We wanted to do a day club/pool party one day, a night club the next day, and maybe a strip club that same night after hours. \n\nSomeone reached out to me right away and introduced themselves. I was impressed but still unsure what to expect. They asked me a couple questions and made a few suggestions based on what we wanted. We let them know what our budget was in trying to make the most of our trip and not break the bank or wait in long lines. They let us know if we wanted tables or just a guest list with no lines, they could make it work and get us setup. They also let us know about their promo for hydration IV being provided for free with a booking. Never done this before but cool.\n\nNow I thought maybe because we were using a third party to book, this was going to get pricy due to the convenience, based on pricing minimums I got directly from the venues. We planned for a table at the night club, and guest list or pay cover for the rest. The exact opposite was true allowing us to book a table in the day, and another the next night. \n\nWe reserved a table for Daylight beach club. We arrived and we gave them our name at the front. No line, quick security check, and we were inside walking to our table. Felt super VIP walking in, like they were waiting for us or something haha \n\nThe next night was our main night so we were excited. We had a table at Hakkasan cause there was a dj we wanted to see. Same VIP treatment, gave our name, security check, and walked in to our table. No line or waiting and we didn't ever feel like we needed to tip more or something, they genuinely made us feel welcome. Hakkasan was great in taking care of us and our table wasn't in the back corner, we had a good location with the dance floor being super close. \n\nAfter Hakkasan, The guys at Vegas club life had set us up perfect with a limo to take us straight to Sapphires gentlemen's club, on a free guest list. Cabs/Uber after a night club let's out, is a one hour process in itself, having a ride waiting outside for us, was perfect. It again felt super VIP getting there as if they were awaiting our arrival. We got dropped right out front, skipped the line, ID check and we were in. \n\nNot sure what time we got home but I know it was now morning and tomorrow was going to hurt. I almost forgot that we had a free IV hydration the next day! We had setup the apt for 1pm which was perfect since it was such a late night. I had never done this before and when they arrived and set us up. 5 minutes into it and I was wondering why we didn't do this every day we were there! I felt 110% when they left. Highly recommended!\n\nLiterally everything was perfect. We felt like high rollers or something based on the VIP treatment we had all weekend! I don't think I'll ever go at this on my own again. They took the planning out of it and just allowed us to show up, have a amazing time and enjoy every minute. No hassle or haggling with anyone, easy communication, and excellent treatment!\n\nI would highly recommend using these guys for making your time truly the best! VIP treatment all the way, no lines anywhere, knowing what we were getting before we got there and already having costs taken care of, made the whole experience smooth and surpassed our expectations.",

The House of Fades is definitely that one shop that if you're looking for the best haircut you can find, this is the place you can get it. The barbers here take pride in their work and it shows whether it's a cleanup or a design you can see the hard work crafted within their work. They make sure you walk in happy and leave happy with an excellent haircut.\n\nI am from Chicago there are many great barbers that have amazing reputations there, yet my first experience in  Las Vegas was hard finding the right barbershop that I could trust with my hair. After many crooked lines and spotted work I found the House of Fades. The moment I stepped in I felt at home, everyone was very friendly and had great classic rap music playing. The ambience was very family orientated just like the shops I knew in Illinois. The haircut and shave I received was about $35.00, this may seem expensive to some but the work they do is worth every penny. From the time I started it was a smooth cut along with great conversation with my barber. Through the mounds of hair that fell from my head, I was presented with a smooth and professional haircut.\n\nWhether you have a regular barber or you get a new one every time you come in they will cut your hair to perfection. They do not make you regret the money you paid and if you love your hair and want great haircuts this is the spot. \n\nThough it may seem easy to find a barber these days or big monopoly such as Great Clips ( that place is horrible, if I could give it a negative star rating I would) it is hard to find a great barber. House of Fades will not disappoint you.  They cut your hair no matter whom or what ethnicity you are; everyone is welcome at The House of Fades.\n\n\nBarbershops are great places to get groomed and connect with good people. House of Fades is one of those rare and special outlets that are always a treat when you go.\n\nThis is Rodney your favorite Yelper signing off! Have a good one!!!",

I have been here for dinner quite a few times so I was curious to see what breakfast was like. \n\nWe were greeted by what I can only say was an absent minded hostess. I was a tad set back by her somewhat rude \"hello\", lack of eye contact, smile and simple customer service. Being the first person to set an impression on customers in such a fine restaurant you would think she would have better greeting skills. We were then taken to our table by another host who not only didn't say one word to us while we were walking to the patio dining but walked so fast we actually lost him going through the restaurant. Only positive experience about the whole entry and seating was our table was in a great spot on the patio with a great view. \n\nWe were then greeted by our server who I would say switched up my negative outlook thus far. She was friendly, personable and attentive. We enjoyed the salmon and Florentine Benedict. Both were very good, the eggs were poached just right topped with a rich Hollandaise sauce.  We then enjoyed a banana foster crepe for dessert. \n\nThe dining experience I would give a 4, the food a 4 and the hostess team a -1\n\nBe careful too if your wearing black because the napkins leave lint all over your clothes.

My colleagues had pasta dishes and I had the prosciutto grilled cheese sandwich.  \n\nThey messed up my colleagues dish ( forgot to add chicken) and then it took a while for it to come, but the hostess and waitress were extremely and sincerely apologetic.

The atmosphere of this bar is lively hipster, and cocktail menu isn't in any way a nod to vintage Vegas, but rather very pretty and tasty signature creations. \n Decor is what you'd expect in a place trying to highlight it's vintage theme, with mid century era pieces like cigarette vending machines, just for show, of course. Not sure if pool cues on the wall are really necessary since no pool table is anywhere to be found. \n Nice selection of craft brews on tap might be my only incentive to drop by again, but I'd have to be really in the mood for rubbing elbows with 20-some year old crowd.\n All in all I didn't see anything that set this bar apart from it's counter parts up and down the east side of Freemont street.",

This is the last of the Fry's Food and Drug (that I am aware of) that still has this old school layout, and for some nostalgic reason I always gravitate towards coming here.  I know where each and everything is and what aisle it's in (all the aisles are even the same) and it's a Fry's so I already know the prices are fair.  Anyway, childhood nostalgia may not be their biggest selling point to their other customers, but at least for me it's a nice little step back to 25 years ago.\n\nNow I have never had a problem with the lines at the registers being that bad or by not being able to get help when I needed it, so I can't vouch for that.\n\nIs this Fry's newer and fancy?  Nope.  But you know what, it's for that EXACT reason that I like it so much.  With so much changing and modernization happening so fast all around us I think it's nice to stop the clock and take a step back and just revisit our old haunts, and this store does just that for me.",

With an attitude the attendant asked me \"what do you want me to do?\" Luckily a manager was available, and he offered to \"move around some reservations.\" Although the rooms weren't readily available to us, we were told to come back at 3:30. We were told this was the check in time, despite 3:00 listed on their website and in the reservation. Also, if you need to check in your bags, know the bell desk will not check in any coolers. I brought a soft case cooler with me with some drinks and snacks and had to lug it around until our room was ready.\n\nOverall once we checked in we had a average experience. The year round pool was open, and heated. Restaurants Pink Taco, and Culinary Dropout were really enjoyable, affordable by Vegas standards, and it was nice to have good food options and not have to leave the hotel. The memorabilia throughout the grounds are with the stay. I recommend grabbing a cocktail, and taking a lap. If you do hit the strip, its a short cab ride, under $8.00.\n\nCheck out was easy, staff (with the exception of the front desk) were friendly. Avoid getting an wakeup call, ours never called us. Good thing we didn't have a flight to catch!\n\nBottom line- you get what you pay for. This place is a good option if you have champagne taste on a beer budget.",

I'm sure other buffets might have certain dishes that taste better or have friendly and helpful staff but my experience here on multiple occasions has been very positive. This buffet is expensive but definitely worth it if you're going to eat the expensive items.\n\nThe food: a.) Crab legs!! Cut in half so you can eat more and not hurt your hands breaking thorny crab shells all day. b.) meat charcuterie - various assortments including what looked like a soppressata.... delish. c.) sushi - better quality and variety than any buffet that I've been to d.) ribs were a little dry but still pretty good. That's about all I ate as I had 3 heaping plates of crab legs.\n\nThe drinks: You get one complimentary champagne or mimosa flute or bloody mary drink. Here's an inside tip for an extra few complimentary cocktails... be polite and sociable with your server and ask them for a hook up (nudge wink). More often than not this place is so busy that they won't pay any mind if you get an extra drink or four... just make sure you tip your server a little extra accordingly.\n\nCustomer service: Here's an amazing story of customer service excellence that I promised the woman in charge Stephanie (spelling?) that I'd write. For anyone that doesn't know this buffet it's so busy that you oftentimes have to sign up via touch-screen kiosk for # of people in your party, time and then you get an estimated wait time. I was here with four friends, two of whom were married the day before, and the line was insane... the place was teeming with people. The kiosk spit out a piece of paper that said we'd be seated in 15-25 minutes. About 50 minutes of being patient later the line was still miles long and there was one Asian girl working at the front lines answering the same questions and looking at everyone's ticket. As it turns out the kiosks were giving people the wrong estimate and when they finally corrected themselves, the wait was was now something completely absurd like 145-165 minutes. I asked her who was in charge and she sent me to this woman Stephanie. I told Stephanie of our plight with the kiosk malfunction causing us to be misinformed. I also sprinkled in the fact the couple was married the day before for some sympathy and she moved us up to the front of the 7 stars line behind one other group. 5 minutes later we were at our table and eating like Vikings. Moral of the story... squeaky wheel gets the oil. \n\nI told Steph/Stef I would write this review and recognize her excellence and my positive experience at the buffet and I finally did. She said she monitors Yelp so I hope she remembers me from late July when we were there.\nMany thanks again!!\n~Travis",

I paid extra for a 10 minute foot massage that was \"meh\". All in, I paid $70 (not including tip) for a basic mani/pedi. There was no area to dry my feet and hands, just spray and oil, so after sitting under the 1 fan for 15-20 minutes, I took my chances and left. 2 hours later my still wet nails were ruined. Where I come from, $70 is at least 2, maybe 3 different trips for a mani/pedi, that probably would have included a complementary back rub, and jetted tubs to massage better than the mess I got here.

    "text": "By far the worst Hotel and Casino in the Phoenix area.  I would not recommend staying or gambling here.  A group of us were attempting to enjoy a relaxing weekend when close friend was recently told to \"evacuate the premises\". Security claimed that he was intoxicated when in all actuality he had tripped on the wet floor.  When he asked to speak to a Manager they arrived with the Police and threatened to arrest us all for trespassing if we did not leave immediately.  Half of our group was not even drinking and were still bullied and threatened by Management that they would have us arrested!!!  Additionally the hotel would not even allow us to access our vehicles even though the drivers had not been drinking...  It appears that the Casino has some type of agreement with the Cab Company to drive up revenue.  I did have a chance to speak with a few hotel personnel outside and learned that the bullying has become \"common practice\".  What was really frustrating to us is that we had witnessed numerous people intoxicated at the pool and the hotel had no problem over serving them all day.  They did not care less about \"intoxication\" and the nudity.  We will not be patronizing this establishment in the future.",

    "text": "I went to Sculptures Salon & Spa for the spa part as I had a Teambuy coupon. The coupon was for a 30 minute massage, 30 minute manicure and 60 minute facial. \n\nMy first impression was unfortunate. The spa is quite cluttered and crowded and ... dirty. The room they use for spa services is so tiny, the esthetician can barely fit beside the table. And it had an old shower stall in it stuffed with supplies and old Christmas decorations. \n\nPlus, the room was freezing and there was no heated blanket or anything to keep me warm. I spent the whole time shivering. The esthetician kept asking me if I was cold and I'd say yes, but she didn't so anything about it. \n\nThe massage was a waste of my time. The esthetician wasn't properly trained in real massage therapy and it was pretty much equivalent to having someone rub sunscreen on my back - for 30 minutes!\n\nThe facial was okay. There were steps in the facial that I hadn't had before in other facials - not sure if that's good or bad!  And she never explained what she was doing, or what step she was at. She also didn't do any extractions. And she included my eyes in all the steps. I was a little concerned at first thinking something would irritate my eyes or the sensitive skin around them, but thankfully that didn't happen. Afterwards my face really did feel nice. \n\nThe manicure was okay, but the room where they do the manicures and pedicures is in serious need for an overhaul. Everything is dirty and well used. The white towels had stains on them and there were splattered all over the walls. \n\nOverall I wasn't too impressed with the salon/spa and won't go back. The esthetician was nice, but had such a strong accent I had trouble understanding her at times. Groupon and Teambuy coupons are really hit and miss sometimes!",

    "text": "I am so glad J-Town finally opened up some restaurants in the area. I frequented this restaurant with my aunt and loved the authentic Japanese food. The concept of an Izakaya is almost one of a Trattoria for Italians and this place is no exception. The food is exceptional.\n\nI have been here for lunch and dinners and the atmosphere is really one of a Diner Dash game with one or two waitresses serving guests and a few cooks in the open kitchen. Izakaya Ju does not feature your typical Spider and California rolls, but rather, tapas items such as Tongue, Pork Cheek, Conch, Spicy Tuna Sashimi, Gindara slice, and BC Tuna. All the dishes are meant to be shared. My ALL TIME FAVE lunch dish is the Beef Curry with rice which is delish, filling and not expensive.\n\nI was here for dinner and arrived at 8:30pm and the place was packed. We were lucky that one table just finished making room for us. In addition to the regular menu, the restaurant features specials written on the chalk board. I suggest you to try the stuff on the board. The food here is so good and fresh.\n\nFor tonight, I ordered a 720ml bottle of sake which comes in at $75 as the cheapest 720ml option. There is some black bottle at $150...in other words, sake is not cheap here. That being said, we ordered the sake of a \"1000 Long Lives\" and it was the hardest, heavenliest, sake I have ever tried. Well worth the $75 bucks.\n\nFYI! When you order the chicken balls, look for the dedicated cook who is responsible for fanning the fire to make the chicken tender and juicy (in order to have that great BBQ taste).\n\nAll in all, I love this restaurant. There is another restaurant beside that has a mostly ramen/noodle menu so depending on what you fee like, you will not be disappointed. The place is small, but service is very homely and the food is so, SO, very good.",

You can take your dogs to parks or breweries, or even dog bars, but at the end of the day, you don't go to these places to play with other people's animals. Mac Tabby is strictly dedicated to playing and hanging out with \"free range\" adoptable cats from Charlotte's own Catering to Cats and Dogs.\nHere's how it works: \nReserve your spot online and come on in. Sun a waiver when you arrive, grab any snacks or drinks you want, and enter through the door. Spend your hour hanging with cats. All of them have different personalities, but they're all sweet and used to people. Tons of toys around and lots of chairs and places to sit. There's calm music in the background, and the whole idea is to just chill. If you fall in love while you're there, the adoption fee is $125 and you'll be helping to home a wonderful animal. \nLori, the owner, has poured her heart into this place - it's clean, smell free, and supports all local businesses like Pure Intentions, Lenny Boy, and local artists. \nOverall, Mac Tabby is a wonderful addition to Charlotte and it's pretty cool that we finally have a place like this. You better believe we'll be back soon.\n\nOh, and if you're not a fan of cats... Try this place. I'll bet you'll change your mind.",

So good! I also love the sticker coconut balls with a peanut filling. The filling has some sugar, but it's not overpowering that you feel that your teeth are instantly rotting. \n\nThe bahn mi sandwiches are yummy. The bread is perfectly crusty on the outside and soft inside. I normally do the meatball. My parents favour the grilled chicken. You can indicate whether you want your sandwich spicy. You can also pick and choose what you want in your sandwich. \n\nThere has been a recent staff change. They are so friendly and accommodating. \n\nRecently, the store has introduce debit as a form of payment. If your purchase is less than $10, there is a $2.50 service charge added.

The rating has nothing to do with blink-182 rescheduling the concert (and thus replacing Weezer, Taking Back Sunday, and Chester French with Fall Out Boys and All-American Rejects) and also that All-American Rejects as pulled out at the last minute due to a band member having surgery. The rating has to do with how the venue handled things. Employees of Blossom Music Center were letting people into the venue after a 10-15 minute walk from the parking lot even when blink-182 were doing their encore performances. Also, they did not handle incoming traffic well at all as no police were directing traffic from the interstate onto the road leading into Blossom Music Center, thus people were stuck on the right lane for over 2 hours trying to get onto the exit ramp. I would not go here again unless they can direct traffic much better as you would be late for a concert unless you left 6 hours before the gates open.",

    "text": "I am a mom in my 40's who had been kind of sedentary, doing the ocassional home video workouts and going on family hikes. My only goal then was to lose the weight I gained since I turned 40. But it was a challenge looking for a gym that has a team patient enough to work with me. I always ended up crying in frustration because I was unable to do the exercises or felt left out during the trial period that I started to give away my clothes that do not fit me anymore.\n\nUntil I learned about Funk Fit on Instagram. I persuaded my husband to go with me to a trial class with Coach David. Yes, I still ended up crying after the class because I could not even do a simple hollow rocks exercise. But then, David sent me and my husband a text message later that day asking how we were and Karen, Alyssa and Laura R. were so patient answering our questions. The sense of community is very strong and for the first time, I felt that I belong. \n\nIt has been almost 4 months now since we started and I have felt that I have improved in strength and endurance since Day 1.  Never in a million years did I see myself enrolling in a strength-training class and here I am going on my 5th week in Strength 1.0. The hollow rocks that I could not do back in May, I am able to do 15 reps now. And just when I think about my body is going on a plateau, the coaches change it up every month so we only perform the same routine every 5 days or so. \n\nIf you are still on the fence about enrolling, think about this: Funk Fit is the only place that made me feel motivated and positive about myself that I have been going almost everyday. There was even a time that I went for 13 days straight! It is like going to the gym and therapy at the same time because I feel good after every workout. Tired, but a good kind of tired. \n\nWant more specific results? Early this year, I started buying size 10 pants and gave away my size 6 ones; just two weeks ago, I was able to fit in my old bottoms again. And no, I did not starve myself or deprive myself of sweets which I can't live without. I have become more mindful of the very first bite I make. \"Making it count\" is what I always tell myself after every time I go on IF. I still eat everything in moderation.\n\nSorry, this is a very lengthy review. But for the past 4 months, I learned that my greatest enemy is myself and I have learned to love my enemy with Funk Fit's help (and my husband Paul, of course!).",

    "text": "Well i have definitely had better smoothie's and the Staff while friendly seemed a bit stressed. The guy making the smoothies i think owned the franchise and the girl that was working for him didn't really seem interested in selling smoothies as she was trying to sell other products in the store. I had a strawberry malt...which was not bad which is why i did give it 3 stars rather than 2. My wife had the Pineapple, Strawberry, Kiwi, with protein smoothie. I tried it and i didn't really think any protein was in it....but wife did and she enjoyed and i guess that is all that matters...LOL\n\nThe other major problem was the price...a small cost about 5.00 for my malt and the smoothie was close to 4 bucks. You can get a large one for that price at Jamba Juice and while the products at Smoothie King are all-natural that is still expensive. So if you want a decent smoothie for the price go to Jamba Juice...if you want all natural, expensive but decent smoothies then go to Smoothie King. Eat, Drink and be Merry my friends!!!!",

    "text": "Came here twice and this place never let me down! \n\nWe made a reservation on Open table at 8pm on a Tuesday night and surprisingly it was overbooked so we had to wait at the bar for about 30min. My boyfriend and I didn't really like that because that's the whole point of a reservation. But it is during the convention week and I think it means the food must be good! We sat at the bar and had their special drink Caipirinha. It was amazing and there, I wouldn't mind waiting :) \n\nOnce we are seated, our server Sergio came right away to take our drink orders and explained how they \"fogo\" here. A little bit later, their manager Ricardo came and said hi. We are very happy at how friendly people here are. They have a salad bar in the center of the restaurant and it has pretty much everything, rice and beans, also lettuce, cucumber, tomato, mushrooms, celery,etc. you name it. As for the meat, my favorite is the lamb with mint jelly. All their other meats are amazing too! My boyfriend literally started to sweat from eating lol we are both on the edge of a meat coma after an hour here. \n\nThey have a card on the table and you are flip them to indicate if you want more. The Green one is more and the red means no thank you. They will keep coming if it is green. The first thing that surprise me is that most of the workers there are from Brazil, managers and cooks. Another thing is that each  \"meat server\" is not just a server, they are actually the executive chefs and in charge of their own meat station. That's why they can tell how cooked the meat are and which kind you want! \n\nAt the end of dinner, I am very positive I am pregnant with food baby! I think my boyfriend too he just wouldn't admit it lol We were so full that we couldn't even move! But wait, what's going on?! The manager brought us desert : their famous flan. It is amazing! The sweet thing is not just the flan but he actually had  \"xie xie\" written in chocolate on the plate for us! because I had mentioned I am from China when he came to the table the first time. My heart melted at that very moment. It is just not a business no more, not just a manager and customers relationship , but more personal and more like friends visiting each other now. I am truly impressed. \n\nWill I come back again? ABSOLUTELY!",

    "text": "So we came to Vegas again and thought we'd try the Bellagio. We live in Dallas and frequently go up to Choctaw or Windstar. Both have their pros and cons- but we thought the Bellagio might be a bit more special. The double queen is mediocre, if you even lift a snack off the tray to look, you're billed. The bathroom has mildew and mold in the shower, peeling wallpaper and the cheapest toilet paper any hotel could buy. This is the Bellagio right, not Best Western?\n\nThe toothpaste we brought with us was dried up, so I  called down to the concierge to ask if they might bring us some toothpaste. Bear in mind, for us and the staff that work here, the hotel is huge. Usually you might trot down to pick it up, but as it's the 'Bellagio' we figured customer service would be great. NO.  The concierge actually seemed incredulous that I would ask. He asked me if I wanted 'delivery'??? I know it's a long way, that's why the onus is on them to provide customer service- Am I mistaken? Does EVERYTHING here have a price? \n\nThe rooms have no amenities other than what you would get in any hotel room, BUT there is no space for anything in the fridge, there is no coffee maker, there's an iron, hairdryer and an ice bucket. Woo hoo. So, can't brew a cup in the morning, have to order it in, minimal bath products, didn't expect to have to beg for anything here. But as the concierge put it so nicely, we COULD pay to have anything 'delivered'. \n\nMaybe they don't have to work that hard to keep customers coming, personally these are just a few small things that mean I don't consider this hotel any better than a Best Western. \n\nExpected more, should have had lower expectations.",

The bruschetta has a thin slice of avocado on top, which really kicked it up. The bacon wrapped dates were divine. We shared the lemon spaghetti with prawns, it was so light and delicious, I'd highly recommend it. We also got the short rib with potatoes, which was incredibly tender, and some ravioli. Everything was delicious, but the lemon spaghetti was everyone's favorite. For dessert we had a lemon hazelnut tart that was just delicious. My drink was called The Destroyer, and it was delicious.\n\nYou have to be willing to drop about $150/person. It isn't a cheap place, and you won't enjoy it if you try to skimp out.

I'm from NYC- the land of bagels and in NYC when you order a bagel, whether it's in a bakery or from a vendor on the street- it is at the very least sliced, perhaps warmed, and served with some kind of cream cheese or butter. When you walk into the tiny shop of Fairmount- you're rushed to order from the plethora of warm bagels all around you. What you get is a fresh bagel (exciting stuff) but it is not sliced, nor is it re-toasted, and you pay for individual packets of butter or Philadelphia cream cheese (no fancy cream cheese here). They throw it in a bag with a plastic knife and send you on your way- oh yeah, the place is also cash only. \nNow the good part, these bagels are delicious! I got a chocolate chip bagel and was surprised by small pieces of orange rind strewn throughout my bagel. An unexpected but delicious surprise. My boyfriend ordered a salt bagel and they honestly gave him a pretzel! The pretzel was delicious but I'm not sure I would consider it a bagel? Overall, the experience was good- we had to eat in our car on a cold, rainy day but I think I'll stick to my NYC bagels.",

Making a reservation was easy and we were able to start right at our reservation time. The waitress approached us for drinks as soon as we sat down to change our shoes. After getting set up and entering our information, we got through 2 bowlers before we encountered issues. The pins would not re-stack. After 10 minutes of attempting to repair it, we were told to continue bowling but still had the same issue. We were about 20minutes into our hour reservation (which costs $60/hr plus shoe fees)\nand we hadn't even finished a full frame. We also hadn't seen our waitress back with our drinks yet. We decided we were done, and informed the hostess who was less than helpful. You would think they would offer to move us to a different lane, or at least apologize, but they seemed they couldn't care less. The hostess just informed us that she doesn't handle the lane fees it's not her job, we would have to take it up with our waitress. Our waitress finally arrived with our drinks, which we enjoyed out on the patio. She was pleasant enough, but she did charge my buddy for a $25 gin when he didn't specify what kind he wanted. I guess that's his fault for assuming he would get the well gin. \n\nAny way cool looking place, could be fun if they get the mechanical issues fixed. And better customer service would be nice",

The chicken pot pie is incredible. The flaky top covers a rich chicken filling that is hearty and creamy. The shepherds pie was great and very filling. The lamb had amazing flavor and was tender. We were won over by the Bailey's Irish cheesecake, the cheesecake is fluffy with a hint of Bailey's and the chocolate ganache is perfectly rich. The ice cream sammie is also great and the cookies are homemade. If you need a after dinner coffee the Irish coffee is so yummy. It is a blended beverage that will brighten your spirit. \n\nThe owner and staff are fun and personable. They make sure their customers are taken care of and have everything they need. The Rogue's bar is comfy and plays the current sports events. In the dining area there is a projection TV so you don't miss the action. My favorite part is the music has been on point and not too loud to enjoy your friends and conversation.",

Great location and loved the decor. \n\nWe ordered the chicken parmesan pizza and the lobster mac and cheese. Pizza was underwhelming, and chicken was a bit dry. But the lobster mac and cheese was really good! Definitely rich and greasy though, so not the best for calorie conscious days. \n\nOverall, it's alright.

They should allow you to order the same pizza as any other one on the menu (which reach up to 22\") and upcharge the crust only -  instead of begin from scratch with an overpriced GF crust and rack up toppings until you have a $30-$35   ......  10\" pizza in front of you.",

    "text": "I visited this place with my daughter yesterday for lunch around 1 PM.  I was sporting a Nike outfit so definitely not looking professional.  Why am I mentioning this? Read on...\n\nSince we are vegetarians, we asked for substituting meat for black beans and give us gauc for rice since rice has chicken broth.  We mentioned if there's a charge for substitution, let us know.  BTW, this is not uncommon and pretty much all restaurants are used to this type of requests.  The Scottsdale branch is actually very good and the staff there offers vegetarians various options right away.  We chose to go to this branch as it was nearby from where we were yesterday and ignoring one of our friends telling us they didn't have a good service at this location.  \n\nAnyway, when the bill arrived, there were charges so we politely asked the waitress about these charges and she said she will be right back.  A few minutes later, her manager showed up and started saying, we don't give anything for free here.  We were in a disbelief as we could not understand what was going on and why he had be humiliate us in front of other guests.  My daughter didn't say a word, but I felt offended.  I asked the manager if he can explain what he was told by the waitress that he had to do this in front of everyone.  \n\nApparently, the message from the waitress to her manager was that we were looking for free stuff!  The worst part, this came from the manager himself!  No wonder this place has pathetic service.  It was insulting.  An ideal manager would have first talked to the customer and provided a simple clarification like, sorry but we charge and that would have been okay.  We almost eat out everyday and definitely know that food is not free!  I had to tell the manager that I have never ever felt so uncomfortable and offended in a restaurant.  The manager didn't do anything to address this.\n\nFor our part, we paid the bill in full and even tipped the waitress.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  I guess I did my part by providing the feedback to the manager.  Word of advice for the chain and the manager - please listen to the customer first.  Also, if you judged me based on my clothes and reacted the way you did, shame on you.  Families do not always show up in formal clothes.  Please do not do this to any other customer as they may come there to spend time with their family or discuss business over a good meal.  No matter what the circumstance, people should be treated with respect.\n\nIt is not always the food that makes a restaurant memorable, but how the ambiance made a person feel. Overall, I would say I would remember this restaurant for its offensive service and would not recommend it to my coworkers, family, and friends.\n\nUPDATE:\nI am updating this review based on the follow-up from the manager who actually took time to revert back on the issue and offered a sincere apology with a gift certificate to the chain.  if the issue had not occurred in the first place then I would have given it 5 stars for food and ambiance.  I am also hoping that my next visit to this place leaves me with a better impression.",

I would recommend this to anyone who is ok with some noise and isn't worried about getting the cheapest food.\n\nI want to hire whoever designed Earl's to design the interior of my home. I love it. It is beautiful in there. In addition, the people working there are pretty good to look at as well. I like the bar area and they have plenty of TVs if thats your thing.\n\nFood, well the food is good. I haven't had anything I've not liked and I've not had anything I am absolutely crazy about but it is quite good. They have a good sized menu that changes pretty regularly so there are always some good things to try. In my last visit I had the fish tacos and they were quite good. Not great, but very good. The beer is also quite good and the selection is better. They also run specials from time to time which is nice however it still is a bit overpriced, even for Canada.\n\nDespite the place always being crowded, I have never had a problem getting a seat at the bar. I am usually here on work travel and eating alone so camping out at the bar is generally my thing but I have sat at tables with people as well and never had an issue.\n\nEarls sits right next to Moxies who I am sure is a direct competitor, but I would give the nod to Earls.",

Keith pierced it crooked and when I went back 6 months later to get it checked one of the other employees told me it looked like it was pierced a little too shallow (for her liking), little did she know that I'd had it done there. After I told her it had been done by Keith, her opinion changed and she said it would be ok.\n I went for a second consultation with a different studio and the person there pretty much said \"it will probably grow out because it's too shallow, and the piercing itself is crooked, it's not due to migration\".\n Now, about 8 months after the fact, it's still healing and I'm not sure if it's going to ever end up healing... there's a pretty good chance it's going to grow out.\n I don't know... maybe they do other piercings better than this... I liked the cleanliness and I know they did a good job on my sisters ears... but they're pretty bad when it comes to navel piercings.",

(the mac and cheese was astonishingly horrible, in a orange/plastic-y cheese kinda way, and everything else just had that gross, re-heated/over-processed taste to it) \n\nBeing in a bleak, dated, windowless room with stale food and the sounds of several children screaming/crying was bad enough. I was sure that I was truly in the ultimate purgatorial situation when OF COURSE some clown on stilts** walks into the restaurant and maintains eye contact with me long enough for me to drop everything and uhhmaybe run out of the restaurant and uhhmaybe leave my boyfriend behind. (Note: you prepay before you enter the actual buffet, so it's not like I just left without paying!)\n\n**to be fair, my fear of clowns should probably have been addressed before agreeing to eat here, because WHY WOULDN'T there be a dude dressed as a clown waltzing through the place and staring whomever they please? REGARDLESS this still doesn't change the fact that this food is not actually food and the ambience is downright bleak. Don't waste your time!",

Our friends got all the smiles and friendliness out of our waitress and it was SO obvious she did not want to give my husband and I the time of day.

We mentioned it to our friends we were with that the waitress didn't like us and they just pooh poohed it.

Every time we are in town we head straight to this place from the airport. Even though we are NOT LOCALS, the cooks and waitresses recognize us.\nNormally we order raw oysters and raw clams to start. Then order the House Gumbo. If we come more than once during our stay, we branch out to other items on the menu. Normally order a 7 on the gumbo. I think that Bob is the one with the heavy hand with the spice, so be careful. His 7 is more like an 8 or even 9. I think if you order a 7 on the pan roast it's not as spicy because of the cream. \nIf you are in the Palace Station give it a try.

I am usually excited at the possibility of discovering a 'gem' off the beaten path, that most people dont know about yet. No such initial excitement from this place.\n\nAnyway, when we were seated, the man taking our orders was rather lethargic. He seemed nice enough, but a bit lost/lazy/slow. It also took them an awful amount of time to get us a few extra pieces of cutlery we requested, or the few extra plates we asked for. \nWe ordered a LOT of dishes, and waited patiently for about 40 minutes until they brought the food. Upon arrival, the food.. was meh. Among the 7 or 8 different types of dishes we ordered, absolutely nothing stood out. What a disappointment.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was also strangely bland. Sun was pouring in through the glass door, and we were seated in a couch-like booth, so one would expect it to be comfortable/cozy, but no. It seemed like no one put in enough time into this place to make it a pleasurable experience. From the waiter to the vibe of the restaurant to the food - it left a LOT to be desired.\n\n..Probably wont go back.",

    "text": "SUMMARY\nWow - we left dinner at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon speechless.  How on earth does this place just have one Michelin star?  Their Seasonal Discovery tasting menu at 10 courses for $188/pp was amazing and blew us away with the creativity and quality.  I liked our dinner better than some of the 3-Michelin places in San Francisco like Saison and Benu.  Even if they doubled the menu price it'll still be a great dinner.  Funny how two of our now favorite (top 10) restaurants now happen to be next door to each other at MGM Grand.  The big brother of L'Atelier is of course Joel Robuchon, whose degustation menu remains our all-time favorite to date.\n\nSERVICE\nImagine eating at a sushi bar with an open kitchen, only that you're getting an omakase of creative French food.  The flavors in each dish really popped, and for French food it wasn't super rich.  Its a bit strange for the servers to reach over the counter to bring and remove plates, but you'll get used to it and the interaction.\n\nFAVORITE DISHES\nFoie Gras Parfait - wow this was decadent with sweetness from foie gras and port reduction with saltiness of the parmesan emulsion.\n\nKing Crab Tempura - I liked how they made the crab bits like two big croutons that went with crispy lettuce, fresh guac, and lime to add some acidity.\n\nSea Bass - Perfectly seared, moist fish, and that Porcini cream sauce with mushrooms underneath. Simply divine.\n\nQuail - Their Signature Dish - somehow they stuffed foie gras inside a already perfectly cooked quail with crispy caramelized skin.  \n\nHangar Steak - This was cooked medium rare and also had a perfect sear and was incredibly tender.  The shallots added some sweetness while the shishito added some mild spice.\n\nWhipped Potatoes - Chef Robuchon's famous potatoes. So creamy and almost sticky in a good way - 90% butter and cream and 10% potato.  And 100% muscle since these are hand whipped by a strong chef - absolutely no electric mixers here!\n\nDesserts - The first was a palate cleaner and was a tart strawberry mousse served in a fish bowl.  The second was a Chocolate plate with a tiara!  Brownies and caramel  are typical but adding a candied pretzel and then ice cream made from Guineas beer?  Wow!\n\nAMBIANCE\nSurprisingly laid back - you could be having happy hour here. The Red and Black theme really makes the restaurant sleek and modern looking.\n\nSERVICE\nTop notch - the front of the house was great and really know the dishes.  A manager did stop by and chatted with us a bit which was cool.",

We got a free appetizer, some chips with sauce (I don't remember what it was called but it does remind me of shrimp chips in some nutty sauce). I LOVED the pandan sticky rice, it was my first time having this kind of sticky rice, but it was SO fragrant with coconut flavour, moist and delicious I couldn't get enough of it- it went so well with every scoop of the curry. I really liked my green curry with chicken, it was super filling, flavourful, and it had a lot of vegetables and ingredients inside. \n\nMy friend got the Panang Curry (Peanut Curry), she was the one who recommended this restaurant, although for an amateur to thai food like me I really enjoyed her dish when I had a taste of it, the sauce was very strong of peanuts, you could see the peanut chunks and the thickeness of the sauce. However in her opinion, she said that traditionally the sauce should be smooth and no peppers should be in it (she rated it to be a 3.5/5). I thought that was interesting! \n\nI would definitely come here again. The plates in my photo looked very small, but the depth of the dish was deep! I would call myself more than the average eater for a girl so it did fill me up quite a bit!",

I never left the front counter. He came back and said to follow him. Again I said I'm here for my pick up. He looked confused and finally realized I was not eating there. All this time I realized that this place was so dark inside. Interesting, they didn't have any windows. I guess if they did you would see the used cars for sale in their parking lot.

To visit our grand mother for her 99th birthday. Because of a delay at the gate we were concerned to how limited we would be for good eats after 11:50pm. We called another restaurant  who said their kitchen was open, but when we arrived, they were no longer serving food. Dejected we continued back towards our hotel, when we saw Primanti Bros.... We took a chance and whipped into the parking lot, I ran inside and asked if they were still serving food... This was 1am.. They said \"YES! Our kitchen is open till 2am on Fridays and Saturdays\"  OMG a kitchen actually open till the establishment closes! Wonderful! \n We were ecstatic, and when we ordered the food, the taste was great. The manager Tanner was great to talk to and laugh with, and Valerie was a fun, quality server. Thank you both for the great end to our evening,",

Hing was our chef and we had him all to ourselves.  He was very entertaining and had some mad skills with the utensils, swirling and swinging them as well as making the food catch fire, in a good way.\n- I had the shrimp and chicken combo dinner, which came with soup (onion or miso) and a small salad to start.  \n- Brown rice is available!\n- 5 ounces of chicken and at least 4 ounces of shrimp for my dinner.  Mel got the filet mignon and salmon for his.\n- Vegetables included mushrooms, onions, carrots, and broccoli.\n- Everything was very tasty.\n- For his finale, Hing did that thing where he tries to catapult a piece of food into your open mouth.  For us, he took one of my shrimp, cut it into three pieces and flung one piece at the b/f.  Missed on the first try, made it on the second.  My turn:  missed and the shrimp piece landed in my napkin--I ate it.\n- Our dinner came to $52 minus the $40 Groupon = deal.  AND, they gave us a $10 gift card to use on the next visit!\n- The place is very nicely decorated and spotless.  Even the bathroom is elegant and pristine.\n- We agreed that we'd return; next time, we'll try the sushi, but it probably won't be as exciting on that side of the restaurant unless Hing has mad skills with nori.",

We decided on these options from their prix fixe menu along with wine pairings, and, of course, the two of us shared.\n\nHe ordered: Tomato Soup with Lobster, Filet of Beef, and Michael's Root Beer Float.\nThe tomato soup was good, but not anything special. I have to admit that I didn't have enough of the beef to provide a fair opinion, and I don't like root beer so I'll leave that alone as well.\n\nI ordered: Wagyu Short Rib Ravioli, Phyllo-Crusted Sole, and the Candy Bar.\nI was expecting the Wagyu ravioli to be amazing (c'mon, short ribs), but it just tasted like what you'd think it tastes like. The sole was actually my favorite of the dishes because it was like butter. The downside was that the crust had a floury texture to it. Finally, the candy bar dessert was tasty, but a little too rich even for a chocolate lover.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't remember the names of the different wines we had, but they did pair them very well so kudos to the team for that. Overall, the food was average. Nothing was bad, but each dish just seemed to be missing its own spark. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive so our dinner experience as a whole was pleasant.",

    "text": "As the person in charge of landscaping for our HOA, I interviewed SEVEN companies specializing in tree care. I needed a 4-story tall olive tree removed that had become an unmanageable nuisance. \n   Patrick, the owner, came out to give the bid. I felt good about him right away. He is an honest and well-mannered person   He gave one of the lowest bids (the bids differed by $300). He spoke with confidence about the job, explained clearly what it would entail, and happily answered my many questions. The job by no means appeared daunting to him. Contrast his attitude with some of the other companies whose reps would talk about what a hard job it was going to be; the tree was so big, it was close to a fire hydrant, they'd have to flag the ground for water pipes, the tree was too near the carport. Then those companies would give me a high bid.\n   I selected Arbor Care and when the tree removal day came, my family and I watched with interest and admiration as the men worked with such expertise and teamwork that they didn't even speak. It was especially impressive when one man was in the tree roping huge limbs, chainsawing and then the men on the ground would receive the limbs, disposing of some in a wood chipper, and cutting some for firewood for our community to share. By the teamwork, we could tell that this group has worked together for a long time. They operated so smoothly and professionally.  \n   Then they used a very powerful stump grinder, removed pounds and pounds of sawdust that it left behind. They cleaned up so well that one could hardly tell where the tree had been.\n   Months later, I recommended them to a good friend who has many trees in her backyard. I went on and on about the company before mentioning Arbor Care by name. She said, \"Oh, you mean Patrick!\" I was quite surprised that she already had been using them for years, but considering their excellent work and fair prices I shouldn't have been surprised at all.",

Century Link took my direct payment auto-billed each month but due to communication issues the money would not make it to Direct TV or Verizon, even though they took my full payment each month the money was not distributed which lead to my TV being cancelled each 60 days at which point I would have to spend 1-4 hours on various customer support numbers having them figure out how to send the money they had collected through Century Link to Direct TV. This went on got over 9 months before I decided that the time and effort I was expending each month was costing me so much time out of my regular life to deal with all this non-sense so in addition to almost a week of lost time given up to them on customer service lines I realized the only way to end the insanity was to unhook my combined billing which they charged me $250 to do even though I had proof that they did this to me through documentation I requested each time I was wrongfully disconnected. This was all irrelevant to them, my wasted time, the fact they pushed me into this deal and the fact they were not prepared to support this plan.\n\nDO NOT SIGN UP WITH DIRECT TV, you will be sorry!!!",

    "text": "Porco is a nice new addition to the monkland restaurants ! They have indoor and outdoor seating and serve brunch, lunch and dinner. The service here is always so great and friendly , they really make sure you feel welcome and Taken care of. I've been here once for dinner and once for brunch and I did enjoy both but I think dinner was better for me. The prices aren't super cheap but aren't insanely pricey either they're just sort of on the border of the two depending what you get . My dinner experience was my favorite we tried the Cuban sandwich and the classic porchetta sandwich both had great flavour but the Cuban packs more flavour and excitement (also larger portion) while the classic is more simple and more about show casing the flavour of the porcettA and is smaller in size. One thing that could be improved on is that the sandwiches don't come with any sides at all you have to order separately. We shared fries and cole slaw as the sides , the fries were sooooo good great golden crispyness on the outside and really nice seasoning. the slaw was ok - it wasn't creamy but rather had a vinaigrette on it which I prefer but I found it had way too much dressing on it which made some bites way too bitter. Brunch was good I had the porcettA omelet and potatoes it was not bad and ingredients were fresh but it was packing a certain something to take it from ok to an exciting dish -it didn't blow me away. Their sweet options looked really good and may have been the better way to go. That being said I would come back for dinner or lunch and maybe if I'm craving something sweet for brunch. This place has great potential just some areas of improvement would be on the Savory brunch items and to have the sandwiches potentially come with a small side.",

My planner brought in a picture of her original bouquet & they did an amazing job that brought my mom to tears! The guests were in awe of the arrangements set out throughout the venue & on the tables. We were able to send home several with the guests at the end of the perfect evening. 3 years later, she still gets compliments on the flowers! Yesterday I sent my Mom a beautiful arrangement, just to say \"thank you\" for being the best mom in the world. She again, was brought to tears! I picked out the arrangement online (because I trust  Cactus enough to send exactly what is listed online). She absolutely loved them! They were so gorgeous. Please do not hesitate using this wonderful company, for all things flowers & beyond. I promise, you will  NOT be disappointed! Thank you, you are the epitome of trust, loyalty & taste.",

Generally, the food was heavy and dull, with little in the way of interesting spices or flavors to liven it up.  Macayo's take on the quesadilla will disappoint cheese lovers, as it is mostly filled with meat and peppers.\n\nI made the mistake of ordering the \"special\" blue margarita, which had a splash of blue curacao.  The server assured me it would taste just like a regular margarita, but it was dreadful - the cloying sweetness completely smothered the lime tartness I was craving. \n\n If  you go, enjoy the fun interior but don't expect a breakout Mexican food experience.",

    "text": "This place is actually my go-to buffet in Vegas. I'm not saying it's the best ever, but for price, quality, and convenience, there's a a reason I keep coming back. \n\nConvenience is a big plus for me. I normally stay at Mandalay Bay or the Delano, and the Luxor buffet is a really short walk away. I don't even have to leave the building since the casinos are attached. If I stayed elsewhere on the strip, I would admittedly change my go-to spot though.\n\nQuality- I stay at Mandalay Bay and I'd still rather walk over than eat at Mandalay's own Bayside Buffet. Yes, Luxor isn't extravagant. If you're looking for king crab legs and lobster and the best cuts of steak, you're definitely going to be disappointed. Walk in knowing that this place offers the basic international fare, and you'll be satisfied. \n\nPricing- This place is expensive by your hometown standards, but it's not bad by Vegas standards. Plus, I always get the $40-45 all day wristband that lets you back in. If you time it right, that's at least three full meals! That's a steal in Vegas! The wristband also lets you into the buffet at Excalibur, but I believe Luxor is the better choice.\n\nService is usually alright, too. Even when there's a long line, the wait doesn't feel that bad, I'm usually seated within a reasonable amount of time for my group size. Everything, including drinks, is self service so you don't really have to interact with the staff. They're usually quick with picking up the empty plates on the table. There's nothing to really complain about.",

    "text": "First stop on our Saturday night  Montreal club romp, we rolled up to Rouge, the only spot on this jammin' street that didn't have a line streaming down the block. Should have been the first sign, but it was early so we gave it a go.\n\nNo cover charge was a plus and as we made our way up to the second floor to check out coats, our first glances were of a filled club of people, seemingly having a good time, kinds of getting into the groove. Could it be we struck gold on our first try?\n\nCoats checked quickly (only $1.50), we headed to the bar. Though our drinks came in the tiniest of glasses (think rocks glasses instead of collins glasses), they were only $13 for two. We would soon come to realize that this would be the highlight of the evening.\n\nFirst major problem: this club doesn't take credit cards! What kind of club doesn't take plastic? Maybe it was because we were American? Maybe the machines were down? (though I didn't notice any machine to begin with) In any event, when I attempted to hand my Mastercard over to the bartender, she waved her finger in my face (no!) and walked away.\n\nAfter settling the tab and taking a gander around the second floor, we knew right away this wasn't going to be the place for us. The club was kind of dingy, the crowd was less-than-appealing and the music was loud and terrible. Not ready to give up, we tried our luck on the first floor. As we walked out onto the dancefloor, the DJ starting spinning \"Whoomp There It Is' and the crowd went CRAZY like he just dropped that new Kayne track. Yep, it was time to go. On the way up to retrieve our coats, there was a wretched stench wafting out of the ladies room. I mean gut-churning, nose-pinching stink. Classy, Rouge, Classy.\n\nAfter doing a bit of research, I quickly learned that Rouge is a 25+ club geared towards the 'older' crowd who apparently used to frequent this other club Angel back in their more formidable years. Yikes. I'd like to chalk this one up to my big tourist mistake of the trip. Le sigh.",

    "text": "This spot turned out to be a pleasant surprise. I tend to avoid the restaurants in the entertainment district as find them to be mainly as see and be seen kind of places with the main attraction being something other than the food. \nThis was a planned event and we had booked in advance. I had already scouted the menu and was thinking of ordering the top chef chicken and the dessert to finish. The server suggested we try out the banquet menu (kudos on explaining this as worked out well). We had a whole bunch of dietary restrictions (vegeterian, pescetarian) as was a mix group of diners. However they were able to accommodate all these things with individual orders for the people with restrictions and shared plates for others. The price points sounded reasonable 55,65 and 75 with the latter two coming with desserts (The price points are different on the website)\nWe chose the 65$ option.\nThe wine list is decent and hits all price points and varieties. Beer selection is OK. \nThe cocktail list is exotic with a cart for the specials. The special drinks looked enticing (made table side BTW) but I didn't want to sully my palate given that we were in for an exotic blend of tastes for the food.\nSingaporean slaw: great as always. An exotic number of ingredients that somehow blend together and provide a nice harmony of taste with a nice fresh tang of the dressing. Sure to impress. Top marks as a starter.\nTofu: Again done well nice blend of tastes and a nice kick to add another level of taste to this dish. \nCheeseburger rolls: Hmm I didn't enjoy this dish. Not a pleasant combo for a taste profile they had beforehand as designed more for the mainstream tastes I think.\nCod with Johnnycakes: Hmm a miss IMO as the sauce threw it off a bit for moi. Johnnycakes didn't add much to this dish as well\nShrimp Cheung Fun: I treat this dim sum dish as it touches the heart (yes that's a literal play on the meaning of the word dim sum ;). A very sophisticated take on this dish with an exotic blend of tastes that somehow blend together and deliver. Top marks as I enjoyed it a lot.\nBraised beef: I had a similar dish at their other restaurant. The meat is falling apart being braised for so long. However the sauces threw off the taste profile for moi with a sweet finish on the sauce. More of a filler IMO.\nTop Chef Chicken: Was looking forward to this. Hmm didn't find it to hit it out of the park. Decent but nothing to write home about. Nice spice on the pineapple though I will try and replicate it at home I think.\nJerk Spice Lamb with plantains: Cooked perfectly rare. Lamb chops are not for everyone and I ended up finishing this dish as there were no takers. Plantains were heavy. The jerk spice isn't my fav taste profile so my view is biased. \nDessert: We had a combo of 4 (with a lava cake for the people with dietary needs) Hmm maybe I was expecting Tong Yuen but this was one of the weakest courses IMO. The chocolate cake was dense, the creme brulee with strawberries was OK, The crepe with ice cream decent, The mango mousse and passion fruit were refreshing and one of the better among the 4. \nCourses I didn't try: Lobster & Shrimp ravioli, Tuna two way taco and Grilled octopus with pani puri were well liked. \nThere was a lot of food for our group. I personally recommend one go the pescetarian way as the meat dishes were the weaker options. The service was good even the namesake chef checking up on us twice.  Nice touch and unexpected. At this price point this is a solid 4 stars bump it up half a star if you want to dine in the see and be seen district.",

We walked in and it was litterally, find a table that wasn't strewn with dirty plates and glasses. It was not a pleasant site.

I want to give them the benefit of the doubt since I've already eaten most of this burrito and would be horrified if is what I think it is.",

We get an extra order of miso soup and salad (it usually just comes with one) and we find that amount of food is more than enough for two people. By the end of the meal we find ourselves in a blissful food coma already dreaming of our next visit... :) we love Pacific East and hope to continue going there for years to come!",

I had just bought the home, and when I went outside there was already a hole the size of a large softball in the outside wall! The woodpecker had already started a second hole as well close by. I found Keaton's company on Yelp and he was at my house within 2 hours. Not only did he patch the holes, repaint them with my extra paint, but he hung special reflective tape and sprayed a special scented repellent 4 feet down from the eave, on the entire north side of my house that burns the woodpecker's throat if ingested. He was friendly, competent, and very reasonably priced!!\n\nIt's now been a month since he's been out and I have had a few pecks from the woodpecker, but only for a second. The deterrents are working! No additional holes or problems. PLUS, Keaton noticed while up on the ladder during his visit I had a few pigeon nests under my solar panels and he was able to put up wire netting and power wash my roof on a separate visit to prevent pigeon problems, and Solar City paid for him to come and out do it, since he is an approved vendor.\n\nExcellent company, excellent service! Thanks, Keaton",

First you can't see the fountains across the street unless you can get a coveted patio table. And the inside is quite loud. Our server was nice but would disappear for long stretches. The tables were small and cleared too infrequently. As for the food, my husband and I both enjoyed our steaks. He had the hanger and I had the filet. He liked the pommes frites served on the side, while I would rather have had some other potato entree. They seemed like cheap filler for the plate to me. Skip the country pate (bland) and the cheese plate was uninteresting and the slices quite small. My son's French onion soup was presented beautifully but lacked the salty velvety texture of a good French onion. We had a few cocktails too. A standout was a good stout \"french manhattan\". Desserts were average as well. My favorite was my husband's profiteroles while the table liked the bananas foster. But I thought the crepes were gummy. Not a repeat!",

    "text": "I have stayed at Hotel32 several times over the years and am always amazed at the level of customer service that is provided.  There were three of us in our group and we had a Loft Suite and a King Connector which is absolutely perfect for 3 or 4 people.  As always, the rooms, service and the extras that only Hotel32 can provide were top-notch.  We had a problem with the sound system in the Loft and a technician was sent up right away to address the problem.  He was very friendly and was able to correct the problem; however, there remained intermittent issues with the music stopping/starting but it wasn't that big of a deal so we didn't mention it. The fantastic shower in the Loft also had a mechanical issue (I'm 99% sure it was a mechanical problem and not something I was or wasn't doing.) as the regular shower head wouldn't come on independently of the other outlets. I was able to work around the problem so I didn't contact anyone about fixing it.  Between the sound issue and the shower issue, it would seem that maybe there are some mechanical problems that are starting to creep up.  It's really not surprising since there is so much high-tech at play in the suites. The staff are always very accommodating in correcting the problems, but it might be time to evaluate the technology in each room as a quality control measure to ensure good working order and addressing any issues  before new guests arrive.  This is still a 5 star hotel and experience in my book and we look forward to our next visit.",

    "text": "Eat is a neighborhood restaurant tucked away in downtown Vegas with a great, friendly atmosphere.  Some excellent dishes.  Some mediocre dishes.  But it's a little hit or miss on the customer service.  \n\nI love this place and I love that it's located downtown.  Finally, a great brunch and lunch spot in the 89101.  Finally, a neighborhood place not catering to Southern California tourists.  It's awesome.  It's friendly.  And it's become so well-known that it can be tough to get a seat.  \n\nThe lunch menu is solid--great sandwiches and salads. The grilled cheese is excellent with thick Texas toast style bread and sharp cheddar.  Simple and awesome.  Nice fresh tomato salad on the side.  The roast beef sandwich is also tasty.  Fresh and thin roast beef with bright blue cheese on perfect bread.\n\nFor brunch, there's a lot of excellent options and some that just miss the mark.  The eggs benedict is delicious.  The chicken fried steak was decent, but not brilliant--more of a kitschy choice but not particularly well done.  The main disappointment is \nthe huevos rancheros dish.  It's an awkward attempt at culinary creativity with peas and sautéed bananas mixed into the savoriness of eggs and rancheros sauce.\n\nThis place has an excellent, inviting atmosphere. In a downtown focused on daytime business and nighttime drinking, it's a nice spot for the locals.  A spot to meet and spend time connecting with people.  And there's a charming porch to sit on when it's not baking hot outside.\n\nIf there's a main setback, it's that Eat can't handle the lunch rush that happens Mon-Fri.  There's so few great food options in downtown Vegas that Eat is crowded every day.  If you're coming for lunch, prepare to wait.  And try to keep the number of your party to 2 people.  The hostesses have a hard time figuring out how to seat parties larger than 2 in an efficient way.  Know this going in and you'll have a great time.\n\nBottom line: 4.5 stars for the excellent atmosphere, friendly service, and generally solid menu.  Minus one star for occasionally cranky customer service, long waits at lunch, and some mediocre dishes.",

I dont really know what to say other than this was the single worst color and customer service experience I have ever received. Got home from my highlight appointment with Chris only to discover that the sides of my head were totally covered in multiple bleach lines from his poor highlight work. I called immediately and asked to go back in to have it fixed. After he tried to tone it, the lines were still apparent. At this point I'm irate as I have paid over $300 for what is turning out to be a nightmare color situation. Another stylist came over to look at me and determined the answer was to do more foils and cover up the lines. I sit for another hour while they do extra highlights. When they came out the lines were all still there. I left the salon nearly in tears with wet hair and insisted that a manager call me, as I'm pretty certain at this point I deserve a straight up refund. When my hair dried, one side is so over highlighted it's practically white, while the other side is basically brown with a white bleach stain on it. It's worse than it started. Not only has the owner not called me, but the salon is now screening my calls. I've called multiple times, left 2 messages and no one will pick  up or return. Since a picture is worth 1000 words I'm posting several. I would strongly advise against this salon unless you want to end up looking embarrassingly bad for several hundred dollars.",

A peanut butter cookie, a lemon cookie, a chocolate cookie, a rasberry cookie, a sugar cookie dipped in chocolate and sprinkles, and a coconut cookie. The only cookie I liked was the coconut cookie. I ended up ordering 3 more! The rest simply tasted like shortbread cookies with mild flavoring, the flavors were far too subtle. Some almost tasted the same.\n\nOverall everything was just okay, but the coconut cookies are worth a visit. The staff was friendly and helpful and the bathroom and store was clean.",

So when I saw a picture on instagram about this place even before it opened, I was really looking forward to checking it out. Turned out I was not happy with my experience! The combo A was definitely not 3 pounds! Or they probably weighted the corns and potatoes and sausages in that 3 pounds too because I had the same combo at Boiling Crab and Kicking Crab all the time and definitely had a lot more than what I got here. The crawfish was probably the size of your thumbs, why is that though, we are not that far away from Louisiana! Most of the clams were just empty shells. I asked for substitution (what we always do at BC and KC) but they didn't have that option. The bag needed more sauce for sure as well. All and all I wasn't impressed, and didn't feel like I got my money worth. It is a new establishment so I hope they will get better, but i don't see myself coming back.",

I ask for a discount on the order due to the time. Short staffed? Ok, but don't tell me my order will be done in 20-25 minutes and almost an hour later it still isn't done.

I believe they pan fry with onion and pepper as well, and that made the dish even better. The dip for the calamari was amazing.\n\nFor the meat we got brisket, pull pork, and rib. The rib was the best out of all the meat, it was not dry and pack a lot of smoke flavour. Brisket was good but would recommend getting half fatty and lean... fatty was too fatty but lean was a bit to dry. Pull pork was good but just overshadowed by the rib.\n\nService was amazing, and they were quick!",

We ordered the kid quesadilla as well and that was a tiny little tortilla with some cheese and folded in half. We get to pay and I told the cashier we had the three kids meals and she informed me that the burritos were not kids items. Kids can only order tacos or a quesadilla. Are you kidding me? Could any one of the three people we were ordering from clarified this when we asked twice about what we were ordering? She did inform me that they could throw the burritos in the trash and make the tacos if that was what we wanted. I know it's just kids meals but I don't appreciate being treated like a moron.",

Now they only had one of the two fav things on the DoorDash menu so I called the store and spoke to a Corey! Now this is an awesome person, he figured out a solution so that we could get me the stern fries even though they are not on the menu and because of the trouble he gave me a cookie! Really can't do better than that customer service! So thank you that location, thank you for always being great, from the front line girls who take the orders and fill up the pop in the fridge to the cooks who have to yell out names and surprisingly got my name right!! Thank you! Side note, momma bear orders, the Priest with the Option but does well done on the Portobello mushroom and burger, and my brother orders the Cali Classic! All great options but like I said my fav is the high priest with extra pickles! oh and the cookies are on point too!",

    "text": "I decided to try out a new nail salon and based on the reviews I read on Yelp, I gave this place a try.  I cannot be more disappointed with this decision.  All these 5-star reviews confuse and blows my mind. \n\n\nWhen we first walked in, everything was good. We were greeted by a gentleman and promptly seated at 2 stations next to each other. They asked what service we were in here for and we responded with Gel manicures. So then they took out the colors for us to chose from; my friend that I went with initially chose a pink color but when the female technician returned with the color, she changed her mind because it looks different than the display. She then asked for a light baby blue color, the technician rolled her eyes and went back to get the different color. In my opinion, changing your mind about your color selection is the least of problems. She did a less than mediocre job and obviously rushed through it. The edges of the nail were not smooth and clumpy. \n\nAs for my experience with this place- \nI also wanted a Gel manicure, I walked in already having an idea of what I want because I am getting my nails done specifically for a wedding I am attending and I have to match it with the dress I have. I wanted white- not french tips but just plain white. The WHOLE SALON, every technician literally looked at me like I was crazy. The gentleman that was working on my nails said to me \"you really want white?\" It was extremely rude and everything just went downhill from there. I can understand if they wanted to suggest something better or had an valid opinion about my color selection but all they did was speak in Vietnamese about it and gave us rude looks the whole time. I may not understand the Vietnamese language, but I do understand facial expressions. Initially it made me doubt what color I wanted but it's what I wanted and it matched the wedding. Anyways, they sent me over to a different station with a women to paint my nails. She also did a below average job. As she was painting my nails, I kid you not, 4 different technicians walked by and watched and as they walked away they were speaking in Vietnamese about my white color selection. I only know this because although they were speaking in Vietnamese, they said \"white\" in English. An older lady said to me as she was staring at my nails being painted, \"Do you know this color is very hard to do?\" Which I found really rude. The lady that painted my nails didn't say one word to me nor did she even flash a smile and acted like she liked being there. \n\n\nThis was a horrid experience and there is no doubt that we will not return. I should have listed to Lisa C.'s review and not go here. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere, there are too many other options nearby than to go to a salon that seems to not care about your business.",

I ordered the prosciutto pie and my friend ordered an eggplant parm pie (no idea how we are still friends).  They do have an interesting beer list, mostly international brews, but very good.  The prosciutto pizza was amazing; light, thin crispy.  Even the Eggplant Parmesan pizza was really good (Side Note: Eggplant Parm pizza was not good as a leftover. The eggplant turned into rubbery tires, not a problem from the restaurant, just a tip.)  \n\nOverall: great pizza, pretty good appetizers, good service.  But its pretty pricey.",

I love having my horseradish raw where I can see it.\n\nThe Ribeye was good. It was juicy. Not one of my tops, but very good. I really liked their chicken parm which is weird Bc I went in wanting meat and then I got the parm and was able to have both! Their Caesar Salad is seriously the best I've ever had. EVER.

We stayed in the inner area of the hotel near the casino. It was quiet and I didn't hear people next door or outside. \n\nThere was plenty of close parking available.  The A/C worked great, and the mini fridge was ok. It kept our drinks cold in the freezer section. \n\nThe breakfast buffet was very convenient and was a great value for what we got.  Hotel is walking distance from the Convention center and monorail.  They have a free shuttle that takes you to Bally's on the hour, but we didn't use it because we have a child with a car seat. \n\nCons: the casino smelled really bad. I went in to the bar to grab a drink and was coughing while I was waiting. The gas station up the street had questionable people hanging out outside that may question the security of this hotel, but I never felt unsafe. There was security in the entrance and I saw several staff members walking g around the hotel at all times.  They advertise free WiFi, but I wasn't able to connect. It wasn't a big deal because my phone had good enough service to stream on Netflix.",

    "text": "Central Phoenix. CenPho. Cennypoo. What am I going to do with you? Every time I think I can't possibly fall any harder for you, you surprise me with something new and unexpected that blows my mind. No, you don't have the stereotypically sexy look at first glance that Manhattan or San Francisco or Chicago do. To be honest I can barely remember our first date, which I think was when I stopped at Majerles in '98 before walking on to Bank One Ballpark to watch the fledgling Dbacks. Admit it, you weren't even trying to impress me back then, were you? I walked you back to my car hoping for a lil' somethin' after the game, but you barely even looked at me and I had nowhere to go. So back home I went, to that hot sexy young thing I was with at the time. What was her name? Oh yeah. Tempe. Wow. She was something. Back in the day, all the other cities would see me with her and glare with envy at how good she looked strutting her stuff on Mill Ave on a Friday night. \n\nSlowly but surely, you began to wage your subtle campaign of charm on me. Even a jaded guy like me began to notice all the little things that really matter in life. I woke up one morning and there you were with a tray in hand and, on it, Matt's Big Breakfast. I'll never forget that other time when you tricked me into wandering up Central Ave and \"accidentally\" stumbling across Lux. Need I go on? It seems like every other time I'm with you, I make a new discovery. The more I get to know you, the more tiny bursts of elegance and grace and uniqueness shower my senses. No, not all of them are on one street tightly bunched together like those snooty runway models New York or San Francisco, which are so uppity that I'd have to be a multimillionaire to even have a chance to really enjoy them anyway, much less afford property. No, you make me dig a little deeper, look a little closer, and do a little exploring before I'm rewarded with your precious gems. A good seductress knows how to maintain an aura of mystery about her. And you, darling, are good. \n\nSo here I am, already having developed a pretty huge crush on you. And then you up the ante by another notch. Cafe Barrio. Barely visible, in a nondescript strip mall by 16th Street and Thomas. On a Wednesday night I walked past a crackhead through the run-down parking lot to enter through a backdoor, my suspicious mom in tow. And once again, you blow me away. The place is packed. I hear laughter, engaged conversation, people with grins on their faces, people on dates, another dude also with his mom (who actually smiled knowingly at my mom as we walked by). An entire world of urban happiness that's invisible to the commuters whizzing by outside on 16th street. What is this food? It's not traditional Sonoran, that's for sure. Ohhhh, I see: it's \"modern Mexican with a heavy French influence,\" as your waitress put it. Sure. Find two of the kinds of cuisine I love most, and somehow find a way to combine them in one, all in an unpretentious setting 6 minutes away from my house. Damn, woman, you are good. \n\nI don't say this lightly. When you came out with a tray, cut open that avocado, and mixed up various fresh ingredients in front of our very eyes to make the tastiest guacamole me or my mom have ever tasted in our life, I knew the moment had arrived. I'm ready to take the plunge. I'm ready to say that I don't want to ever live anywhere else, because there is no way I could get to know someone as intimately, as closely, as sweetly as I do you. Yeah yeah, there are other fish in the sea. I know that. But you're my fish, Cennypoo.",

After the 2nd and more thorough power-spray the home looked ready to paint.  Poor power-spraying means the paint will not adhere well and cause it to peal.  \n\nSo, great company....great painters...just inspect your exterior after preparation and before you allow them to paint.  And make no mistake, you do control whether they paint or not.\n\nAgain, good painters, good prices, good people....just inspect in stages before allowing them to proceed.",

I don't worry about any of that with her.  He loves Stacy...he hates to be groomed, but loves her.   Stacy has groomed Elmo for about 6 or 7 years now.   She does a wonderful job, is gentle and the price is very reasonable for a mobile service, where I don't have to leave home.   She remembers that he doesn't do well with the powder or anal glands, so I never have to worry about problems or reminding her each time, and he gets the short body, long face/tail cut that I like every time.   With a Lhasa, where long hair growth is an issue, she takes extra care to shave around his private parts, which is appreciated when he doesn't bring \"leftovers\" into the house.   He prances and runs like a puppy (even though he's 14 years old) after his grooming, showing his appreciation, too.",

I enjoyed the food, we had the multigrain chicharron, cauliflower tostada and jackfruit taco. The trouble is - it is just damn hard to do a taco right. Every ingredient has to be stellar. And I've simply had better. So while I enjoyed the food I wasn't wowed with bright, fresh flavours and an amazing tortilla. These are the things I'm looking for in a taco! \n\nGranted we didn't do an extensive sampling of the menu so maybe we missed their best dish it's hard to say. I definitely would return, especially if I was just looking for a pretty space to share a few dishes if I wasn't too hungry. Of course if you're vegan that's also a big draw here - still most Mexican restaurants have some vegan options. The other issue is price. It's quite pricy for what it is. Although for the location the pricing is normal. I see it more as paying for a nice ambience and fairly attentive service. But if you are looking for the most quality taco/Mexican dish I think there are better options out there.",

However not everything in the room was remodeled and some comers were cut to save money. Connecting rooms are available (sometimes). Cons: everything else is a con. The pool, the distance from the main strip, the false advertisement, the spa and fitness center and much much more suck ass. Lots of hidden fees for the room. They tell you a total up front and then tell you a whole different total when you check out. If your lucky, or if all the other casinos are chafing more than $300 for 2 nights then you might think it's worth staying here still, but your forgetting one thing. If you want to go to any club, the drives back and fort are going to cost you more than if you just paid more to stay at a better casino. Last but not least, the room sucks as far as noise goes. You have constant noise no matter what. You will think it is your A/C but you will later find out that nope it's not. With all that said, I would definitely not recommend this casino to anybody. Not my friends or strangers. By the way, I gave 2 stars only because I feel sorry for the casino.",

But even italian restaurants in Iowa give you some pepper and parm to add to the oil you're dipping it in.\n\nEscargots were bad.  Lacking flavor, under seasoned, and 17 bucks for 1.2 ounces of snail meat just isn't a good deal.  Only good thing is that once you ate the snails you could dip some of your leftover bread in the snail sauce and the bread absorbed enough of the flavor that it wasn't bad.  If this is the best they can do on snail meats they should honestly take them off the menu.  I could do better than this at home.  And I've never even seen a snail.\n\nScallops I had were okay but not great.  Tasted surprisingly fishy for scallops.  It wasn't necessarily a bad fishy taste, but wasn't something I was used to at a nice restaurant.  Seemed weird.\n\nMy gf ordered a steak and it was good but I thought this place was French.  It's not like they're gonna beat Craft or a dozen other places on steak.\n\nSides were pretty meh.  We had the rat one, plus pommes puree.  They're relatively cheap (6 bucks vs 11+ at some places) but they also weren't that great.  I guess they're rated okay, given the relatively low price.\n\nBottom line is I'd go elsewhere.  You can do better at this sort of mid tier vegas price.",

I called and made an appointment because I wanted my gel manicure, gel pedicure (1st time) and eye brow wax, and it was a Friday and I know how busy it can be. I was greeted warmly and it wasn't too crowded so I was seated for my pedicure first. Pedicure was nice and the conversation with the gentleman (the owner) was easy. His English was excellent. When it came time for my manicure I had pointed out that because my hands were dry I had a couple of tender spots and to go easy with the nail filing and cuticle trim. He understood and was gentle! I've had it with salons that one, when I ask them to do exactly what I asked at this salon, I get a nod okay, but they don't do as I asked because they didn't really understand me in the first place. Two, you are given your own package of nail and cuticle trimmers, like your supposed to for hygenics. The place was clean and did not smell. The other clients were regulars and the conversations were easy and friendly and not gossipy.  This is now my new salon!",

There were 26 of us that night go dinner.\n\nWe started if off with the seafood appetizer, stuffed mushrooms and fried calamari.  All the appetizers were delicious.  We then had their Caesar salad which is made right there at your table.  I love anchovies so I was very impressed with the dressing.\n\nI ordered the Oscar filet mignon.  All I can say is that it just melted in my mouth, it was so tender!!!! We ordered the twice baked potato, creamed spinach & steamed vegetables. I tried a little of everything, but I would definitely recommend the twice baked potato. It was crispy on the outside and creamy deliciousness on the inside. \n\nThe cocktails were good and strong just how I like them, and the service was absolutely impeccable.\n\nWe were all so full we couldn't even order dessert, but the table next to ours ordered the banana foster and it looked amazing!!!\n\nThey brought out a dessert for my cousin with a crazy sparkler on top.\n\nLet's just say the evening was off to an excellent start.  Next stop Intrigue Nightclub to work off those extra lbs!!!",

It still has circa 1983 glass block low wall dividers with tables that I'm sure have seen better days.  But you really are coming for the food.  And boy is there food a plenty.  The prices are dirt dirt cheap.  A veggie combo (4 different scoops of veggies/lentils/hummus etc) set on fluffy injera (with more injera on the side) is a whopping seven dollars.  Go for broke and order the large combination which comes with three meat dishes. It'll be $13.99  At this rate you can afford to have chai teat (hot or cold) and dessert.  Now I didn't try the dessert, I'm informed however it is baklava.  I will be back soon.  This is the type of place where you come to sit with a friend and talk.  The service is languid (i.e. not fast) but then again, they aren't going to hustle you out either.  It looks like they must have a hoppin' night life, with it's raised stage and what appears to be a screen broadcasting Ethiopian news.   (Oh and it still looks like the old Bacchanal, so it's like Greek restaurant meets Ethiopian teenager bedroom with crooked posters on the wall)  Overall though, it's a nice treat to be able to get away from the hot outdoors, break some spongy bread and not have to drive all the way to Tempe for some ethnic food that is a little less run of the mill than our usual taco joint.",

The management/service is probably the worst I have seen in the food industry. I'm not a negative yelper EVER, ho ahead and look, but I am doing this to help the biz out.

    "text": "This is a real bummer to have to write this review because I only like writing 5-star reviews. But this is a precaution to those who've never stepped foot in Abbey Dental before. This is my overall experience. Do with this information what you will.\n\nWhen first walking in, I had gone to the counter because there was no one at the check-in lectern. No worries there; it was just timing. As I took my clipboard and seat, I saw an abundance of [empty] chairs in the lobby. When completed, I handed my clipboard to Roxy who was more focused on her computer screen than a patient in front of her. Next, I asked her about my insurance and said I have the information for her. She replied with zero eye contact, \"We don't need it.\" I replied, \"Come again?\" She repeats, \"We don't need your insurance. They'll explain your pricing options once they see you.\" I ended, \"Oh-kaaaay..\" With only 2 people before me, I was waiting for a good 20-30 minutes. During this time of waiting, I was getting frustrated w/ their 'bait & switch' tactic. One patron before me walked to the counter asking how much longer as she was waiting a long time. This too made me feel more uncomfortable.\n\nIn the room, their consultant began to explain prices for wisdom teeth extraction. I had stopped her to explain that I didn't like their 'bait & switch' of paying in full first, then me having to ask my insurance to reimburse me. At that time, I was ready to jump out of the chair. We concluded to just take the X-Rays (a free service...the lady helping me was super nice!) since I was there. The orthodontist came in to visually see my teeth (no mask on) and we concluded I needed a 2nd appointment since the primary Dr. who does extractions wasn't there. It was then that I needed a 2nd solution.\n\nThe consultant who gave me prices was nice and walked me out the door to explain and point to which building my appointment would be at. I walked to my car assured I wasn't coming back.\n\nReason for my 2-Star Rating: 1) Roxy's lack of care for the incoming patients (your body language speaks even when you don't..and I felt uncomfortable when being logged in). 2) Bait & Switch payment structure. You must pay IN FULL before any insurance kicks in. 3) No mask on when observing my teeth. Thankfully, he was wearing gloves. Finally, ...4) When in the parking lot, you see some doctors smoking with their blue gowns on outside. How is this not a health and safety issue!?!? \n\nI wanted to give this place more stars...I truly did. But I'm looking out for future patients that may be interested in coming here. I have a marketing background and I understand how jingles and TV/radio commercials work with the subconscious. However, personal experience is how you'll retain clients. Sadly, I won't be returning..and I hope my review awakens others to do the same for the benefit of their comfort (poor customer service at check-in), their wallets (upfront payment), and their health (doctors smoking outside in their gowns).",

We looked at 3 or 4 houses together and he taught us a lot about what to look for, how much the house was truly worth, what certain renovations would  end up costing - and, after like 15 years doing real estate in Madison, he has the experience to back it up. He could practically be an appraiser he knows a ton about the structure of house and where there may be problems lurking.\n\nFast forward to August and we happened to bike past a house that from the outside was exactly what we were looking for. Texted Paul and he texted right back saying \"I can meet you there in an hour.\" He's always insanely responsive via text or email and there when you need him.\n\nWe spent two hours walking the house together, asking him dozens of questions and he had so much knowledge on no matter what we threw at him. We realized we wanted to put an offer on it. Paul put us in touch with a lender friend who got us pre-approval that day (at 4pm on a Saturday no less) as we were in a hurry to beat the open house the next day. Paul wrote up all the contracts that night at 11pm, we had an offer on the house within 24 hours, and the sellers accepted the next day. Paul is the guy if you are trying to score a great house on the isthmus where good property moves very quickly. \n\nHe took care of everything over the course of the next few weeks as we were getting married and going on our honeymoon. Yeah, terrible (or, great?) timing.  We didn't worry about it at all as we knew the process was in good hands. We came back, had the inspection, and closed within 30 days of making the offer. We basically owe our awesome new house to Paul! Highly recommend.",

Korean food is mainly spicy and here you will find really spicy fire chicken which in korean is called bonga buldak sans the place's name. Aside from that ttokbokki (pronounced tapuki) is really good nicely cooked and flavorful.The general appeal of the store is a basic family run looking place, not the fanciest decoration but specially at night they play korean music video and the place is flocked with young korean students. Me and my boyfriend frequent the place and are known by face by the owner ( i believe). Service is nice and people are pretty attentive. Price is good as well and you can have a dinner with a side menu for around 25 for two people.",

    "text": "All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi should never mean cutting corners.  \n\nI decided to come here for the first time and the experience was 'just okay'.\n\nSushi, nigiri, rolls, cones all depend on a properly prepared rice base.  If the rice is bland and if the chef puts too much rice in the serving then it ruins the sushi experience.\n\nThere were two menus for lunch.  One did not have sashimi and the other did (for $14.99 wknd lunch).\n\nThe sushi was underwhelming and on the bland side due to the rice, some of the fish were fresher than others.  The nigiri tuna and salmon were cut thinner than anywhere I've been, but the inagi (eel nigiri) was very good.  \n\nThe tempura on the other hand was perfectly hot and crispy in its glorious tempura batter.  Both vegetable and shrimp tempuras were awesome.  The avocado hand rolls were also a highlight.\n\nThe miso soup was okay, but nothing special.\n\nThe service was friendly but dare I say discombobulated.  I don't know if the waitress just woke up, but she wasn't very good at bringing everything in due order, but in a piece meal manner.  \n\nThe presentation of the food is nothing special either, it's sushi on a plate and you are expected to eat it not admire it.  Which takes away from the spirit of Japanese presentation.\n\nThe restaurant itself can use a good updating as the 1990's decor is a little old.\n\nAnyhow, this place will not be a regular place for me, perhaps when I need AYCE sushi in a pinch but no more than that.  I'll definitely be looking for a better AYCE sushi place.\n\nEND",

    "text": "First off let me say that not being available for late check-ins is absolutely ridiculous.  You are in the hotel industry and people arrive at all hours and times when traveling.  Corporate needs to take this to heart and make some changes.  This being said, we arrived late, around 1:00am but luckily the live in manager was available to let us in.  Apparently, they did call at 2:00pm but my crappy phone didn't relay the message until later.  We just flew in and had a red eye flight, so that is why we had the late arrival.  The first room given had no sheets on the bed but we had to phone her again and she gave us another room which was nice.  The decor is very modern but it is cheaply made.  The bed was ok.  It was a studio and it had a fridge, microwave, flat screen tv, etc.  To me it seemed like a nice motel for a decent price.  It had nice landscaping and nice decor. The only downsides were the weird riffraff hanging out on the porches.  It seems like these motels with kitchenettes always have weird people staying there like its their home, and not many people who travel coming to stay there.  It is sad because us travelers want to have a nice cheap place to stay as well.  The other downside was the unbearable smell of cigarettes in the room.  It was overpowering and I woke up congested the next morning.  Also, the room floor was not cleaned that well.  As far as the neighborhood, I never thought it was a ghetto, it looked nice to me.  Overall, it was a decent stay for a cheap price.",

They all have a wealth of experience and a range of expertise to meet your tattoo needs. I'm sure they can do any style well. \n\nI worked with Jock, and you can see my X-wing turned out AMAZING! We started with a consult  to go over what I wanted, and Jock came up with some ideas. We had a fairly in-depth discussion together on how to make it fit with placement, orientation, perspective, and size. Eventually, he and I agreed that it needed to be bigger to reflect the 3D perspective of the ship shooting at it (previous tattoo).\n\nNot only did Jock go above and beyond for the tattoo, but also stuck through my squirming at the worst parts. Plus, he's a Star Wars fan, and I'm glad to have a fellow fan doing the art for me.\n\nCheck them out on Facebook and Instagram, and go in for a consult if you're thinking about a tattoo. They will find an artist to fit your desires and I'm sure you'll be satisfied. I also added another Star Wars tattoo that Jock did here too.",

My brother and I agreed to change flights because of this. The attendants told us to sit down while everyone boards the plane. That's all they said. My brother decided to go to the bathroom. After he leaves the attendant tells me they don't need us to volunteer, to just go ahead and board the plane. I go to get my brother and come back. Within the 2 minutes I went to the bathroom they closed the doors and they told us we were too late (our friend had boarded the plane already, she said there were tons of empty seats and that they took about 45min before taking off). At this point the attendant tells us he'll book the flight at 930pm and that we don't get the voucher. We speak to the manager (who was extremely nice, and so was the attendant at the kiosk) but they said they couldn't do anything to assist. That we would just have to wait. The problem is we were never told we couldn't leave the boarding area. Also, they gave us such a small amount of time before we were \"too late\". Make sure next time you volunteer please get proof of it. Since we had no proof they did not compensate us and we lost about 5 hours at the airport.",

Sycamore has been on my radar for a while when I rode the light rail into work from the Scaleybark Park & Ride - From the outside, I got to see the construction going on.  For the longest time I would see the brewery name \"Sycamore Brewing\" and just wonder when they were going to open.\n\nI've been a couple times and have been impressed by their selection of brews and really welcoming atmosphere.  Their tap room heralds warm wood paneling, concrete floors, and clean lines.  No kitchen here, but they have food trucks that pull up to the side of the outdoor patio and the staff can just focus on the beer.\n\nThey do a brew run at 12pm on Saturdays which is fun - choose between 1, 3, and 5/6 mile routes and then come enjoy some brews afterward on the patio on a nice day.\n\nSycamore is just a great addition to the SouthEnd neighborhood.  Convenient to the light rail and has a large gravel parking lot so you can come enjoy some local brews!",

She said someone was going to clean it off for us and they'd sit us right away. Another group was also being seated at the same time as us and as we approached the area, the other party of four was deciding if they wanted to switch and go snag our table in front of the fire. I said to our hostess \"Oh no, they're gonna take our table we requested!\" and not once did she step in and tell the waitress in front that she was about to sit us there. So yeah, that was kinda frustrating.\n\nOther than that, our waitress Brie was helpful and had an awesome personality that lightened up our mood after the table incident. Drinks were good, although wine by the glass is pretty pricey. Beers were reasonable. I had the chicken and broccoli penne, which was more than enough and I ended up with lots of leftovers.

    "text": "Having heard about Hakkasan from friends in London and Hong Kong, I was excited to dine at the restaurant with my friends. As a vegetarian, I was impressed not only by the large variety of vegetarian options at the restaurant, but also by the relative authentic flavor of the dishes. Without doubt, Hakkasan is a restaurant that is friendly to both vegetarians and carnivores. \n\nAll my friends agreed the soup in Hakkasan are authentic and well executed, and they highly recommend the soup to Yelpers. Their favorites are chicken soup and the lobster soup. The former composes of red dates, black chicken and several Chinese medicine ingredients. According to one of my friends, she never had this soup outside of China, and was impressed by Hakkasan's effort in creating this dish. Another friend of mine also greatly enjoyed the lobster soup, which had lobster, tofu and mushroom. In her perspective, the mushroom enhances the flavor, while the tofu complexes the textures. \n\nFor vegetarian Yelpers, I recommend the mushroom lettuce wrap, which is a refreshing alternative to the tofu lettuce wrap. While the pine nuts increases the texture of the dish, I suggest the chef increasing the ratio of mushroom to pine nuts in order to further enhance the flavor. I appreciate the waitress promptly refiling the lettuce for me. \n\nThe vegetarian dim sum platter is a beautifully decorated dish that I would suggest sharing amongst friends. Although each dim sum was well executed, it tasted very similar to each other. All the dim sum were mainly composed of mushroom and used similar sauce. I recommend the chef increasing the variety of ingredients and sauce for the dim sum platter. \n\nWhile my friends and I greatly enjoyed the food at Hakkasan, we recommend the manager to provide more training to the waitresses. Our waitress was attentive, but she did not seem to know the menu well and asked my friend repeatedly where she saw fresh lemonade as a drink. As the lemonade was advertised as fresh, I hope Hakkasan will provide fresh juice instead of the sparkling lemonade in the future. \n\nI recommend Hakkasan to friends and couples, who are looking for a Chinese restaurant with well-executed food and a hip vibe.\n\nTip for Yelpers:\nYou can stop by the reception of the restaurant to make reservations throughout the day, if you are not able to reach the hostess via phone.",

We took care of the food, chairs and blankets and let Jolly Roger make himself at home.\n\nHe arrived early and before the start of the party with all the things he needed to pull off a great show. He brought his own music and had a microphone and speaker system to make sure everyone could hear his performance and some really cool and fun music to keep the kiddos dancing while the party was getting started as well as during intermission and once it was over.  \n\nHis British accent and his quick sense of humor was like a breath of fresh air and kept everyone involved and on their toes.

There is plenty of selections for everyone if, you do not find anything you like to indulge in well, then I just don't think you like food very much lol. I know we literally stuffed our faces into an afternoon nap lol \n\nI started from the right side with fruits, and freshly made pancakes, made to order egg omelettes, French toast, delicious freshly squeezed orange juice, I had pasta, I had Asian food, Mexican food, I tried a bit of just about everything. We then took a breather before we unleashed ourselves upon the almost endless dessert bar m, that has tons of pastries and all sorts of desserts including gelato & made to order dessert crepes that you can add anything from nuetella, fruit, nuts, you can top it with ice cream literally, you can add whatever you like. They even have a candy station whattt!

I dig it and the music matches. Plus the pizza is A-OK. \n\nTonight I ordered three slices of pepperoni. That is three slices of thin, wide, greasy NY style pie just the way I like it.

The real MVP of this place though, is the dancing area in back! The songs are metalish and amazing to dance to. The crowd there is great too, many are in there 30s and 40s and, like us, were not at all bothered about dancing like lunatics for 2 hrs. The only downside is that one guest here was clearly high on several drugs and was harassing us, and then two math teacher look alikes threw beer at us (probably for our appalling dance moves). Overall- can't recommend this place enough, the dancing and music even for non goths were fantastic.",

It JUST opened so there was no location on the map for it yet, but I had such a great experience that I wanted to at least give recognition to the chain. Great service, appealing interior and delicious food.  \n\nThis was my first time here but the gentleman at the cash didn't seem to mind that I was humming and hawing while I stared at the menu (I felt bad because I know this is annoying, ha)! Instead, he offered his help and talked me through a few of the items that I expressed interest in. I ended up ordering the breakfast sandwich with a kale and mango smoothie. Mmmm! Both were great! I sat near the window - the store had lots of seating and was very clean. I was also impressed by their menu. They seemed to have just about everything and could accommodate vegetarians, or dietary restrictions. Baked goods, meals made to order, you name it! I even noticed their attention to detail like having lemon water in a beautiful glass dispenser for customers to help themselves. \n\nYou know the place is good when you want to head back to try something else! Thank you for starting my day off right, Aroma!",

My lease specified a lost parking pass was $50, then in the middle of the lease, management decided to switch from a sticker permit to something you hang on your rearview mirror and made us sign an addendum to the lease that increased the cost to $150 and also stated they would not replace it.

    "text": "We were happy to find a veg place nearby our AirBnB accommodations, but were a bit disappointed with our meal. \n\nWe ordered the \"albalone\" appetizer, \"beef fun\" dish, and \"beef\" sandwich.  The first thing I noticed was that all the vegan versions of the dishes were priced higher ($.50-$1) than the vegetarian versions (they all list both prices).  Since typically for a vegan meal you are taking away an animal product (eg, egg) this doesn't seem fair, but maybe there is something else making it more expensive I'm not aware of. \n\nOn to the food - in summary, the flavors were uneremarkable, and in the end (about one hour afterward) we were hungry again and our stomachs were a little upset. \n\nThe abalone was just like a thick noodle/starch with no flavor (the sauce was very good).  The beef fun dish was good, but greasy and unfilling - it seemed like sprouts were the go-to filler. The sandwich was plain with the same \"beef\" and many shredded carrots on a soft bun. \n\nFrom other reviews it appears we should have ordered different dishes, which would warrant the higher ratings reflected. So perhaps we just chose the wrong options. If I were in town longer I might return to try the crispy chicken or crispy pork rolls.  It's great that LV has this much-needed option in town for veg food - since it appears to be a well-loved establishment.  \n\nThe atmosphere reminded me of places in Chinatown in Seattle ... minimal ... which is fine if the food is good.. The service was just fine, nice people.\n\nNote that it's cash only, which necessitated a quick trip to the ATM!",

Before you roll your eyes and think we are tech-illiterate, I was with almost 30 people, all of whom know our way around our smartphones like it's our backyards.  Calling down to housekeeping to request more towels was a chore!  And then at one point during the weekend, our room phone's screen went black, so we unplugged it, and plugged it back in, only for it to turn on so we could order room service, then have the screen go black again!  Annoying.  \n\n-the back staircase leaving Marquee is just unacceptable.  How do you have a glitzy sparkly club like Marquee and then have the back stairwell so undone and disgusting?  The hoards of people going down those stairs was scary - in heels, a little drunk and stumbly.

Been going to that one since 5 years old. Most likely won't be back to this location just because they quality of the food, the messing up the orders and how long it took.",

Our garage door broke and the A1 team came in, gave us quite a few options, all of the information we needed for our insurance claim, and very accurate and well-prices quotes. The time from purchase to installation was long, as we had a custom door ordered, but the team insured that our door was functional until the installation was complete. They installed the new door, and then we realized the door they installed was not the door we ordered. The team acted quick to get the correct door back on a rush order, and were very good at communicating throughout the entire process. They took ownership of the issue, showed great integrity throughout the process and now we have our beautiful garage door, which added incredible curb appeal to our home. The owner and GM even texted me to make sure we were satisfied. We are. I've referred all of my neighbors, and rarely write reviews, but had to for this one. Great team. I'll post pics in the future.",

I haven't been writing reviews lately but I thought I should share a bad experience.\n\nI've only been to the place once.  After eating our meal my friend and I noticed there was a sign on the door that said no credit cards.  Oops!  I never carry cash.  We ask the server if there is a nearby ATM.  The server said they would take my debit card.  Excellent, I thought to myself and gave them my debit card.  Payed the bill (signed the receipt) and took off.   (I did not enter my pin)\n\nA few days later I realized there was a big problem.  My bank statement showed a transaction of $500 the following day.  Then another $500 the day after.  I should note that I NEVER USE THIS CARD anywhere except at Chase banks to withdraw or make deposits.   I reported this to the bank and luckily they took care of it without much trouble.\n\nI just wanted to share my experience.   Whether it was intentional or not the truth is the problem stemmed from their payment process at this establishment.  Again, I do not use my debit card for anything other then banking transactions so you can make your own conclusion.",

My friend and I ordered steak...I a New York Steak with Bernaise sauce....it was good, I was just not expecting the steak to look so thin and long...but I still enjoyed the steak and sauce...what I wasn't too crazy about was that they served it with a boat load of pommes frites.  Now that I know, if I go again, i will ask for veggies or something else on the side...I just don't think it went well with the meat...or maybe if there were less of them and more of something else..,but hey..maybe that's how they do it in France!  The waitress was nice and she was very helpful when my friend asked to put the bill on her players card...we found out that the restaurant is not part of the hotel so she had to go back out to the players card desk and ask for some kind of paper in order to charge the bill to the card...but it ended up working out...and it was just find.  Prob the only reason that would make me come back here is to get a patio seat and eat, relax, and watch the Bellagio fountains across the way.",

    "text": "I hesitate to be critical of a place when it's only just opened. But I do this because I hope some of the problems can be fixed.\n\nI'll start with the positive. The vibe of the place was great. I'm a huge fan of the building. The aesthetics of it are awesome. It feels small and intimate, but looking around, it can obviously accommodate a lot of people. From what I've seen, it's more geared towards large groups of people, with many large booths with room for 8.\n\nThere are a few problems that I'm sure every restaurant has when just starting out. The food took a very long while to come out. Which doesn't make sense, because not many people were ordering food. The most disappointing part was that the menu was limited to about 4 items. I went there on the third day they were open though, so all of this is completely forgivable.\n\nThere are a few things that I would expect to be more difficult to fix. Parking was a huge PITA. We parked about a half mile away, but I guess that's to be expected in Old Town. The location is right across from a biker bar. With a bunch of people coming and going from there with open pipes, it was difficult to have a conversation indoors next to a closed window. I imagine it was much worse for everyone on the patio. Above all, I don't think the quality of the food justified the price. I had the blue cheese burger, for $13. It was cooked to order nicely (med-rare), but had little flavor other then the toppings. The meat itself wasn't spectacular, which is what I would expect at that price. And the parmesan fries that came with were bland and came in a small portion.\n\nThere's a good amount of buzz about this place, and I think it shows promise. I definitely want to come back once they've settled in and give things another try.",

    "text": "Right now ,I'm giving it 3 stars (though I'd lean to 2.5. It's the 2nd night/morning of a 3 night stay. \n\nWe showed up at 5pm Sun night. Our room wasn't ready, though check in is at 3. As you know it's hot as h*** here, we were told that we could wait in the little office area. I inquired about a late check out. (My flight doesn't leave until 6;30 and we did not bring a car, just using the rail and bus. An extra hour or 2 of not carrying around our luggage would be nice) I was told that was unlikely. I pointed out we were already 2 hours past our 3pm check in and our room was not ready.  I was told had we shown up earlier they would have started our room then. So I guess if that's the case you could say our check-in was held up by 1/2 an hour. So to me I think we should at least get a 1/2 hour late check out. I'd be willing to pay a little extra beyond that. Since check in isn't until 3, and they're still working on rooms until past 5, I don't see how leaving our room until one of the last (again) would be a problem. \n\nThe desk (I'll assume manager) was very polite and helpful when we first got there. He got a bit of an attitude (as did I, though not at first) when I came back because our room wasn't ready. Since he had said late check out was unlikely, I asked why we couldn't get a late check out, if we couldn't check in on time and our room wasn't done. Obviously the time between noon and then it was not being worked on. He offered nothing except either a refund or a plastic chair to sit on in the office. Not a late check out, not a small discount, not even some free coffee (I'll get to that later). However after getting into the room when I called for extra towels and an extra pillow, he was very polite and they were sent in minutes.\n\nPros: Price, for a place with a kitchen under $50 it is a great deal! Deposit was only $25 (hotels.com said $50) wifi only $5 for the whole stay, not per day and it works pretty well. Room was clean (floor could have been a little cleaner). Flat screen TV. Dresser and plenty of hangers for our stuff. Ceiling fan, A/C is ice cold. Call put in for extra towels and a pillow were answered immediately. We were also offered a crock pot if needed.\n\nCons: Room not ready when we got here. Regardless of how long you stay, you don't get any more than 1 packet of coffee, any more than that costs a dollar a piece. The \"stocked\" kitchen is minimal. Very few utensils or dinner ware, also no dish soap or sponge to wash dishes. (Obviously no dishwasher) In fact nothing is stocked. Other than the one complimentary coffee and a bar of soap, none of the regular hotel items (creamer, sugar, shampoo, conditioner, ect) are included. Toaster is broken however if you mess with it enough, you can get it to work. \n\nNeutral: While the towels are small and they only give you 2 and the pillows flat and only give you 3, they did provide extra when asked. Bed was ok. Not exactly comfy like a nice hotel, but not too bad (I've had worse at other cheap places) office manager, as I said earlier for the most part he was polite and courteous, but a bit gruff when I complained about the room not being ready 2 hours after check-in  (so I can't really put that in the pro or con category) The property doesn't look real nice, but its quiet and no problems so far. I was able to track down a housekeeper to get some dish soap and a sponge.\n\nSince we've only stayed two nights so far, I'll update if there are any other positives or negatives for the remainder of the stay",

I'm new to the RV service culture being a new owner, but do not understand why they need to keep my vehicle for three weeks before they even get to the diagnosis? Seems like I could just keep my vehicle and bring it in when they are ready to actually work on the repair. I was given a date when they would get to the repair and the date came and went with no communication. A few days later I reached out to them...numerous times...before I finally got my estimate for the repair. I had a small piece that needed to be repaired in my awning and I was told I needed a completely brand new awning. I'm going to shop around more for an estimate as I'm perplexed this piece can't be replaced. I had them add some support straps to the plumbing and that repair was fine. However, due to the lack of communication and going far beyond what I was told when I would get my vehicle back I would avoid these guys.",

    "text": "As a Dbacks fan I have to say this place is one of the best spots in the valley to catch some spring training. I have attended many games at this park until this weekend we have never encountered anything negative. Thank you to Ron who was working section 126 on Saturday his actions caused me to wright this review. As I was watching the game in the 7th inning this older gentleman with a cane had watched people leave from the handicap section and had decided to rest in an empty chair that someone vacated. That is when Ron came over and took the chair from this guy so as we were setting against the light post We offered him a spot with us. When I asked Ron why he removed the chair from that guy he informed me that he was doing his job and that the guy needed to buy a ticket if he wanted to set in that section when I asked his name Ron was polite enough to give me it and also wanted me to know that he will introduce me to his supervisor when he comes over to that area. I understand if this was a young guy that was just being lazy but we all could see this was a guy in his 60 that had brought his grandson to watch the game he was not trying to steal a cheaper seat he just wanted to finish the game cheering on his home team (those Dodgers). So I recommend this place to enjoy Arizona Spring Training but if Ron is working you better not be misbehaving because he is just doing his job. I will be back so I hope I can set up a meeting with his supervisor.",

    "text": "On my most recent visit to Dana park, I was threatened with jail time by security for having an app open on my phone.\n\nPokemon go players are no longer welcome at Dana park. When the mobile phenomenon was first released, Dana park's social media pages were quick to post pictures of how many Pokemon and pokestops were in the mall. This drew many of my friends and countless other players to the mall and its businesses.\n\nHowever, many people are now being harassed by security, being told that Pokemon go is not allowed and that if they are seen again they will be sent to jail for trespassing. This is written nowhere, and the management has not responded to the mass demand for answers on social media. Instead, all of the previous posts inviting Pokemon go players to the mall have been deleted, and security continues to harass players when they are doing nothing wrong.\n\nIf you are looking for a safe and inviting place to shop and dine, avoid Dana park. They will pull your car over for no reason or even stop you while you're walking from store to store just to make sure you aren't playing a game.",

This place will become irrelevant on it's own when a trendier, more hipster-ish place opens up a few blocks away from it. Either way I would suggest the following:\n\nBreakfast for 2 shouldn't cost over 40-50$ - you are selling eggs, greens and bread.\n\nYou shouldn't have to dress like a trendy hipster-douche for breakfast\n\nThis would be considered a painfully average place in a city like MTL or NYC\n\nStop TRYING SO HARD to be cool...from your staff to your salt shakers\n\nStop offering cash only and skimping on declared sales to revenue Canada - that wouldn't be an issue for me if you charged a reasonable price for EGGS and TOAST.\n\nOwner seems a bit pretentious and definitely overconfident in his prices. Please be aware that this is a breakfast and sandwich spot. \n\nOh the potatoes are never cooked well but that's ok really... they look good in the background when each patron of yours is busy instagramming or tweeting their funky salt shakers.",

    "text": "Low Quality Furniture And Horrendous Customer Service \n\nMy brother purchased a 'brand new' large sectional couch here. Upon delivery, Half of the sectional was new, the other half was VERY obviously WORN and USED- absolutely NOT brand new, which is what he purchased and paid for. \n\nThey did rectify this and changed out the old, worn out used couch that they tried to pass off as New for an actual new piece as should have been delivered in the first place. \n\nAfter his absurd experience, I should have know that this company does not act in good faith. \n\nI purchased a couch set myself. MISTAKE! \nThe fabric is pathetically thin and cheap, that even the delivery men tore a hole in back of the couch upon delivery.\nI didn't want an electric powered couch or chair, but the sales woman rushed me through and convinced me that I'd love it. \n\nNOT! \nThe cords are extremely loose and disconnect themselves so often that I don't even plug them in or use the recliners. It just makes me angry when replugging them in multiple times a day considering the $1200 price tag on this piece of junk- might as well avoid it all together! F*** it!\n\nWhen the couch was delivered and I saw how cheap the fabric is when it tore with such ease by the delivery men (who did replace the torn piece) I knew my my gut was right and I made a terrible decision. The delivery men assured me that I could return them and even stated that they had a returned couch in their truck that was purchased over a year ago. \n\nAfter being perturbed on a daily basis by this horrendous purchase, I finally called to return/exchange the couch (less a 15% restocking fee- fair enough). \n\nIt's in pristine condition and even still has the tag on it. \n\nCustomer service told me that they'd come and do an evaluation and decide if it's in good enough condition to be returned. \n\nThey inspected my couch and were astonished at its pristine condition, and said that they'd be in touch within the day. \n\nNo such luck! I called a week later and spoke with the SAME manager who set up the evaluation. \n\nShe stated that it's been over a year and that she wouldn't allow the exchange. \nThey wasted my time with an evaluation that obviously had no bearing on their decision and I was given false information about my ability to return/exchange the piece of garbage from the get-go. \n\nI spent a few thousand dollars here, and planned to spend more, and am absolutely astonished at the shitty customer service and lack of caring about customer retention. \n\nI'm not asking for a miracle or for an exception, I was asking them to stick to their word which is clearly crap. \n \nI clearly will NOT be returning to this store and will absolutely tell everyone I know to steer clear of it themselves after my and my brother's experience. \n\nBy the way, the 'Clearance' section is also known as the 'USED' section, unbeknownced to most!!!!",

I think there are 2 different entrances? The door that says \"inside\" on the front is an extension of the coffee shop and is a sort of communal chill spot. We peeked inside and there were a few people working on their laptops...very quiet. The entrance to o+v we took was the third door down on the east facing side of the building. Upon entering o+v we were told we could take a seat anywhere. Great atmosphere and delicious food. My friend and I ordered the bread per recommendations read on yelp and we each got a flat bread. Soooo good. And the flat breads are a good size, nice portion. I got the prosciutto and pesto and my friend got the earl. The jalapeños on the earl were spicy! But good! The burn was real though. We had to ask if they had ranch....we were worried if that would be insulting haha. But they had a sauce similar to ranch that was ranch like but not? Our waitress said its better than ranch and it was really yummy, definitely cooled our mouths from the spice. Great place, definitely recommend.",

Menu has a lot of variety, may be hard to choose what you want: apps, salads, pizzas, and various ethnic entrees, plus juices. \n\nMY LITTLE DUMPLING: steamed Shiitake and spinach dumplings. Easily some of the best dumplings I've had, stunningly good quality. They were clearly fresh and handmade, with ample filling, and a tasty dipping sauce to boot. But $6 for a portion of 5 just-bigger-than-bite-size bits was steep.\nDOWNTOWN TONY: Trio of portabella sliders with kale and sriracha aioli. Pretty good execution, good choice of mini brioche buns, but the aioli was so sparingly applied it seemed to be on there for color rather than flavor. Dish is plated with some simple potato fries and a house-made ketchup. Again, good quality!\n\nDishes are flavorful but sophisticated, with a  price tag to match. Solo lunch above was a hair below $20 with tip. Service was polite and attentive, really love the way they've styled the space! I'll come back to try their vegan sushi and bao.\n\nEDIT: Dropping a star. As happy as I am to have vegan options in Vegas, this place is inconsistent. Most recent visit was sorely lacking in both food quality (boring, simple dishes) and service (inattentive, lack of knowledge when we had questions about specific dishes).",

As seniors, at the suggestion of one of their food servers, a couple of the members of our group have ordered off the children's menu.  But 10 days ago we were suddenly told that ordering off the children's menu was not allowed.  I understand a change in policy or perhaps a new manager wanted to enforce an old policy.  No problem.\n\nBut after this we submitted feedback on the Chili's website inquired about what other options (senior menu , smaller portions, etc.) might be available.  Like any \"family\", could some of us select children's portions as long as others were ordering adult entrees? Received a prompt (canned?) response that this was an area of concern for them and a general manager and/or area manager would contact us within 2 days.  But as you might expect, there has been no follow-through on contacting us. \n\nOh well, we made an effort to make it work but have found several other restaurants willing to meet our needs.",

I called twice to make a complaint about the nurses and nothing was done and nothing changed because I went back for another appointment and had the same poor experience.

I'm very sad about my experiences with this office because I LOVE the doctors and my fiancé even went to dr.

If you want actual food, then I'd recommend the wings (one of the best I have tried in Montreal), or their burger. The pub is also great for watching sports, as they have a few TV's dispersed inside.\n\nAll in all, it's not such a bad place, it has got its perks and can be fun, but don't expect anything stellar.",

I've had a couple of dinners there since my previous reviews and my usual feeling leaving is one of disappointment.  The most recent visit was for a friend's birthday.  I had the half Cornish hen which was served with cauliflower and spinach.  It basically tasted like chicken in gravy with a measly portion of veg.  I was still hungry after it and it was not in any way special.   The friend across from me got butternut squash pizza which was tasty but cold.  The still lovely staff presented the birthday girl with a chocolate mousse thing as a cake substitute at the end which was OK.  The desserts in general were underwhelming.  In general people I talked to afterwards were not impressed and thought it was overpriced with mediocre food.  I don't know if some of this relates to Rob Rossi's departure as executive chef, but I think it will be reserved for wine and cheese nights for me from now on.",

Now that we've cleared the air of any haze of uncertainty and made it known that I have not set the bar particularly high, let me say that this particular Panera bread location is performing a great disservice in the way it manages its menu.\n \nI hope that you won't judge me too harshly as  a pendant for mentioning that the grilled chicken Mediterranean flatbread sandwich, advertised as being served with tzatziki  sauce, was instead served with a pumpkin colored, paste-like curried  condiment.  \n\nWhen this happened upon the first occasion of our visit to the establishment we took it as a fluke and a simple mistake. Three weeks later we have returned and the curried serpent has reared its foul tasting head having been slathered upon my wife's sandwich once again.\n\nWhen she inquired as to why there was no tzatziki sauce on it this time the young lady replied that they were out of it and that the curry sauce was what was \"closest\" to it. \n\nThis is truly unacceptable and flat out wrong. I realize that the fine staff at Panera might not have the culinary wherewithal to come up with something close to  tzatziki on short notice but curry paste is a far cry.  Why not just let the customer who is ordering the item know that they don't have the necessary ingredients to make it? It seems logical but I fear logic may not be present in the lexicon of those running the establishment. \n\nAnd finally, Panera has seen fit to remove the one menu item which I truly enjoyed, the chilled shrimp and avocado salad sandwich. Now my choices containing any sort of protein not mammal or fowl related are whittled down to no choice at all... just one item, the soba noodle shrimp salad. This could be a well-made salad with nice flavors but instead it takes several very fresh but unseasoned and completely flavorless shrimp and mixes them with soba noodles, sliced cabbage, and some spinach leaves and as the coup de grâce drowns the whole thing in a palate-numbingly tangy vinaigrette which renders all the remaining ingredients undetectable.\n\nA little seasoning, some toasted sesame seeds, perhaps a  hint of citrus or some other semblance of flavor would go a long way in this otherwise abysmally bland concoction.  \n\nIn the end, after my wife was informed apologetically that the curry paste was substituted for the missing tzatziki sauce she asked if she could purchase a cookie. \"Sorry, but we're closed already\" replied the young lady.  \n\nIt seems, as Robert Frost said, that perhaps we should have chosen the road not taken and picked another restaurant for our evening repast creating a fond memory of a meal enjoyed. \n\nPanera need not worry about our return as I for one shall not be back.",

We were there right before the symphony and ballet were starting (reservations at 6 before shows at 8) and it was super crowded. The main floor was at capacity but we were told to go back through the kitchen and downstairs into the basement. It was utilitarian, to be sure (cinder blocks, plastic deck furniture) but not really a problem.\n\nThe terrible aspect of it--and the reason this wasn't more stars--was the service. Our waitress was either dealing with all the tables upstairs as well or just didn't know what was going on, because she seemed totally and utterly bewildered (beyond the usual frazzled state of a busy waitress). Totally in over her head. We were there sitting down to order at 6:15 and our main course wasn't there until around 7:20, by which time we needed to be finishing up so we didn't miss our 8:00 events.\n\nI know some of this has to do with the kitchen being busy and it wasn't her fault, but that was still problematic. A half dozen times she came by and said it'll just be a few more minutes. We ordered a hummus appetizer and she brought too few pita bread pieces, and then took forever to get more.\n\nThis is a nice down home place and at any time other than the pre-theater rush, is probably a great restaurant.

I also had vet records from previous vets sent to them ( previous vet could not understand why my cat was getting so heavy--they never checked his thyroid either) - I took my cat to the vet always.\n\n- My cat had MOUTH CANCER AND THYROID ISSUES YOU NEVER FOUND THE MOUTH CANCER YOU COULD NOT EVEN DIAGNOSE THE SWOLLEN THYROID --   \nCheck every cat for thyroid that walks in the door so many of them have it save yourself some work. When you give thyroid meds do it twice a day not just once.. Once a day is NOT EFFECTIVE I was told later.           \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     Original review               I had a really bad experience here . They misdiagnosed my cat saying his thyroid was fine even though he had a huge lump in his throat ( later oops it was thyroid). My cat ended up dying and during this long process they offered me EXPIRED meds. Now I read a review on White Pages and a person said this. When I read her review I thought she was a nutcase. The owner told her this did not happen well now I believe her because it happened to me. \n\nThe worst part was this vet tech they had that held my cat down so hard he was screaming like he had been hit by a car. She never offered to let me help and calm him she was brutal. They were trying to get blood from him and later another vet said he had a mouth tumor that was huge ( they also missed this at Companion) so no wonder he as screaming. \n\nI still remember his screams every time I have to drive past this place. I realize cats die what I am upset with is the poor medical treatment and Dr Kay was nice and friendly but that did not help my cat. The other vet Mia Hospel was useless. \n\nThey seem very worried about folks complaining to them they look at you as if you are a horrible person to question them. They should put that energy into actually improving their practice. \n\nI really wonder why they had small kittens being adopted who are  playing with cats who are sick being brought in?\n\nA really good vet is hard to find but since then I have found an awesome one. If you want their information message me",

Okay, maaaybe a little bit worse. \n\nIm not sure if they still have the same crew working there or not but Daisia, the girl who answered the phone, should work somewhere else or go to a Customer Service class. I called and she answered with \"Can I put you on hold?\" then didnt wait, just put me on hold. A couple minutes later she took my order like she has waaay better things to do and completely disregarded my request to get a phone call when the delivery man was outside my door instead of a knock. Of course the delivery man came to my door and knocked loud enough to wake everyone up and get my dogs to bark up a storm. He said he wasn't told to call and then slammed my screen door. So I called the store again and miss Daisia answered with her 'hold' greeting and when I asked to speak to a supervisor, he apologized and said there was \"nothing he could do\". I hung up and proceeded to just eat my food and put it all behind me. But the bread was still VERY doughy and the pasta was so hard, it was crunchy. I threw that crap away. I made sure to get my refund but wow, you guys suck!\n\nI tried giving them a second chance but the food came out just the same and the daytime manager was rude enough for me to write my first bad review on here. Apparently all the breadbowls come out doughy unless you call to let them know you want it cooked all the way through. Maybe if I order wings they'll deliver a dead chicken and tell me I shouldve called to have it cooked instead.",

Although I've tried their fried rice and noodles before, I think their strength still lies on their bbq items.  I especially enjoyed their free range chicken, and in my opinion they serve the best free range chicken in Toronto.  I've tried many other places uptown for free range chicken but nothing is as good.  Their other bbq items such as duck, pork and soy chicken are quite consistent as well.  The price here is also very reasonable.  For lunch box, one can always expect generous portion of meat, vegetable and rice for 6-7 bucks.  This is really what I call hearty Chinese bbq at its best.  The owner here is also very friendly and I always got free stuff during my visit.",

    "text": "For a smallish restaurant that does Chinese, Thai, and sushi in Bethel Park, Rice Inn was a pleasant surprise. Inside what seems to be an old Pizza Hut, Rice Inn is nicely decorated and appears very clean as my first impression.\n\nAs for the food, my fiancee and I ordered the rainbow roll, the fantastic roll, and salmon and red snapper nigiri. The fish tasted quite fresh, and the rolls were neatly made. The service was very quick; we probably weren't waiting more than 10 minutes for our rolls, even though the restaurant was starting to get busy for dinner on a Friday night. I was expecting the fantastic roll, which was considered spicy, to only by seasoned with spicy mayo as many \"spicy\" rolls are, but the crunchy tuna was actually spiced inside the roll with a little more kick. It was *fantastic.* The rainbow roll was also delicious, with fish and avocado on the top of the roll, as opposed to all the fish inside the roll as some other restaurants make.\n\nOverall, it was priced about the same as what you would expect from most sushi joints, ~$12 for a higher-end roll and ~$4 for nigiri. The waitress was friendly, and for the quick service and good sushi, I would wager we will be back soon!",

However I am so glad I trusted it's 4.5 star review instead!\n\nThe food is exactly what I craved. Delicious light corn chips with fresh guacamole, wholesome indigents filling flavorful tacos, and a perfect, classic, sipping margarita to wash it down with.  The entire menu is labeled with gluten free and vegan options (endless appreciation for that!) and the service was exceptional. The ambience is casual, but warm and inviting with soft lighting and comfortable tables. \n\nWhile I was there I even got the meet the owner, who was going table to table ensuring guests were satisfied and being well served.  How often do strip mall restaurants feature that kind of attentiveness?!\n\nIf I lived in the area I would definitely be a repeat customer many times over. They even have a convenient  to go window, which would no doubt fuel my stomach and soul on a regular basis. \n\nI can't comment on the \"authenticity\" of the food, however if you want a solid fish taco and great service, look no further.",

Our one-night staycation at this renowned resort exceeded my expectations.\n\nWe lucked out and stayed in one of the renovated casitas.  It had plenty of room all around; what a perfect layout!  (An extremely comfortable king bed, a desk, a sitting room, a fireplace, walk-in closet, flat screen TV, large bathroom and a patio with a gorgeous view).  In addition, they have every amenity one would expect and more.  High end spa products, robes, mini-bar, etc... plus extra special touches such as a flash light on a keychain for wandering the property at night, and a bedside book for your reading pleasure entitled \"Life is Good.\"  Our casita # was 282 in case anyone wants to put in a special request ;)  It's located near the Golden Door Spa which I'll review separately but highly recommend!\n\nDuring the 24 hours we spent at The Boulders, we sat by the main pool, had some lunch, visited the spa, Jared played a bit of golf (I hear the course is pretty spectacular), saw a coyote, worked out in the top notch fitness center and movement studio, had a glorious breakfast at the Spa Cafe, and were blown away by the friendly staff / service all around.  \n\nThe Boulders truly provides a Zen-like experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing get-away in a first class resort.  I will warn you, it's pricey in high season.  Thankfully, we did have a gift card this time... but I can't wait to return and take advantage of their summer rates (which I hear are pretty incredible).  \n\nJust like the book that sits bedside in the casita, staying at The Boulders really does remind you that \"life is good!\"",

Most of my friends ordered drinks and snacks, and the bartender kindly offered waters to everyone who didn't get anything. The seating perfectly accommodated a decent sized group and the atmosphere was very laid back and great for talking and catching up. \n\nThe only (slight) downfall, in my opinion, was the menu. Nothing really appealed to me, but that could just be because I wasn't very hungry. However, they allow you to order pizzas to be delivered there- something I've never seen anywhere else. I like having this option and will definitely give the food a try another time. With tons of board games you can use, I can see this being a place I'll spend more time at in the future!",

There not stingy and they really wanna make sure you enjoyed your food. The downtown pita jungle is really quick with to-go orders and its so nice to be able to grab a coffee at lolas next door or relax while waiting for your food, location is killer. So without a doubt this place is definitely a five star for the food. But the reason for this review was with my last visit in to my neighborhood pita I was pleasantly surprised with 2 of the employees. Walking in I was greeted at the door with a huge smile and not the everyday cliche line of \"welcome\" but a \"hello,  how's your day going, lets get you inside and out of the heat\" I did go at a busy time and the young gentlemen (jose i think) had to put me on a small wait. He than asked if I needed anything while I waited, he went out if his way to grab me a water. Unlike usual hosts this gentleman didn just stand at the host area he was walking around looking for tables and even bussed my table and a few of the  other tables as well. He got me seated as soon as he could. This was just the starting to my great visit! I was sat in a nice area by the window, my waitress Colleen came as soon as she saw me and took another drink order. She was very good with me, always coming to refill my drinks my food was prompt and she helped me try something new! The restirant was very busy but she didnt make me feel rushed or was short with me because she was stressed about her other tables. THIS IS HOW RESTAURANTS SHOULD BE. Colleen was restaurant responsible with the small talk not in any way inappropriate and very sweet and genuine. To say the least I was very pleased. Jose and Colleen were both well dressed, hair done and well put  together unlike some  service staff at pita jungle I have had before. I recommend this place without a doubt! And if you haven't already you should be trying my new fav the grilled veggie salad! :)",

In the front is the takeout counter and if you continue walking to the back there is the restaurant. \n\nService - great, willing to answer any questions (which there were many) and attentive and checked up on us often to see if everything was ok. \n\nFood - Mutton roll - SO GOODD! Crisp crust, not super oily and filling is delicious and not spicy. \n\nHopper combo 1 - hoppers alone dont come with coconut sambal, so get the combo. These were really good!! A cross between an idly and a dosa, I would actually prefer these to either, because it's the best of both worlds - crisp shell with a thick spongy interior. \n\nChicken Lamprie - this was ok - I think next time I would try the veggie. While I love the diversity of the dish, I think the proportion of rice to topping was a bit off. It was good, but didn't blow me away. \n\nOverall, would definitely return just to continue trying the diversity of items they have on their menu :)",

It came smothered with green chili sauce, lettuce, and queso fresco and the corn tortilla is definitely homemade and absolutely delicious. The chips and salsa are amazing too. They come with a green salsa that tastes a little like an enchilada sauce and is so yummy. They also have a small salsa bar. \n\nThe only downfall was they did not have fountain drinks. They are on the menu so maybe the machine was down? No worries, they had Mexican bottles cokes. \n\nThe owner and a younger kid (maybe his son?) served us and were so nice, friendly, and helpful explaining menu items and making suggestions.

The DJs are always changing, but I've never been there and thought the music was terrible. It starts getting really crowded around 1 am, and everyone is really sweaty and dancing. There's a lot of room downstairs, so it's good for groups. There is one area for standing around and ordering drinks, and a separate area for dancing. The music would be too loud to hold a real conversation though. Another thing I like about Sotto is that you don't have to dance with the group you came in. Oftentimes, I will end up dancing with another group for a little while. Everyone is very friendly. Definitely go to Sotto if you feel like dancing, but don't feel like getting hit on (if you're straight.

    "text": "Heard about this place from a friend. I decided I wanted to check this place out after dinner nearby.\n\nThis is an absolutely beautiful place with the patio theme indoors. I really loved everything i tried here.\n\nI had a group of 4 and we basically tried many items. Staff was very tentative and polite. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nBael Tea+Chia seeds - I personally loved this drink. Yes, it is very light. It was supposed to be a detox kind of drink. I'd def want one of these after going to the hot yoga studio. \nBlue Pea Lemonade - I'm personally not a fan of lemonade but my bf ordered this and he liked it. \nHK Egg Waffle - DO NOT EVER CHANGE THIS!!! I was the most surprised by this. I've had egg waffles in Vancouver and different parts of LA but it never gets this close to HK! I'm most pleased with this!! I'd say that it was a bit brown which worried me but it wasn't burnt or anything. Had that nice crispy crunch and soft inside. Yummmm!! \nHoney Toast - Nice and crunchy, not over drenched in butter and the honey is on the side so it doesn't get soffy. Love!!! I also liked how it was cut into pieces. It reminded me of that honey toast i had in Japan and missed so much. I had the corn berry swirl ice cream with it. Very delicious!\n\nI was with two other friends and they ordered more but i can't remember what everything was. However, i do know that everything that is there i loved! Its a nice and quiet place and i hope it doesn't blow up and ruins that calming vibe and that lightly sweetened desserts. I don't like anything loaded in sugar and this place is great.",

We were immediately greeted when we walked in, and the hostess/waitress sat us within a minute.\n\nThe menu is very overwhelming because it is 3 LONG pages of food with prices. They had 3 Thursday specials on a chalkboard in front of the hostess area. Since the menu was so overwhelming and the specials seemed like a good price, I ordered the Italian Trio. The Italian Trio consists portions of chicken parmesan, lasagna, and baked manicotti. The special also comes with lovely sized salad and two rolls of ciabatta bread.\nAll of that for $11.95! I also ordered a fried cheese appetizer (4 cheese sticks), which was $6.25.\n\nAfter about a 5-10 minute wait, the salad and bread came out. The rolls were steaming hot and the salad (Caesar dressing) tasted fresh! Our fried cheese appetizer also arrived. Holy moly...those cheese sticks were delicious. The marinara sauce that came with it tasted amazing. I'm assuming it is homemade. \n\nFinally, the Italian Trio came out. First thought? That is a lot of cheese. That is way too much for me. I'm already full from my salad and bread. The baked manicotti was the best part of the dish. The chicken parm comes in 2nd place and the lasagna came in 3rd (however, I'm not a lasagna person).\n\nFood was amazing. Service was excellent. Sandra was very kind & answered all my questions. She was very sweet. I will definitely come back again if I'm ever in the area.\n\nI was with a friend and our total bill was $32.26 (2x Italian Trio & 1 order fried cheese). Definitely worth it!",

There is a manager in the back, but I guess she can't come out and help... maybe I will update to better (or worse) shortly. Update..... didn't get any better... Definitely deserves 0 stars!!! The manager finally came out to help after I got called up.... I can see why she stays in the back!! She had a horribly ugly attitude to say the least... I, like others that have commented felt threatened by the manager... I was a bit baffled that they still charge a $200 deposit with a major credit card.. I expressed that I would not use their company again, as enterprise does not do that and they offer a AAA discount as well.. She very rudely began to explain they have to do that  because of all the bad people out there... I said don't worry, just please finish up so I can leave. This is all while she has a customer at her desk.. She gets up, walks over to the desk where I was at... as she's looking down at me while I'm sitting in the chair starts bobbing her head from side to side saying I will deny your car if you keep talking like that.... I said wow, your really professional and asked for my transaction to be completed again so I could leave... If I didn't have a insurance tracker on my car currently I would of got up and left without the rental.. But I don't want to drive my car out of town with a tracker in it.. and being spring break I wouldn't be able to find a rental anywhere else... So, the other lady goes with me to the car to check it for damage. I ask her if the car has a USB connection. She pops her head in and looks around, then says no. I got in and saw the USB connection right away.... BTW, if your driving out of town be prepared to stop and get gas as they don't give you a car with a full tank of gas.. Hertz your horrible employees are driving away customers!!!",

    "text": "My overall experience was very good. For a vegas restaurant, these prices are really very reasonable. You can pay more for a steak at many of the generic steakhouses inside casinos, and the wine by the glass is really very reasonable at 7 or 8 bucks per glass for their more basic wines (I had both a sauv blanc and a glass of gsm and both were good and recently opened). \n\nAs for the food:\nI started with the sea scallops which were in a mussel cream sauce. Outstanding, though perhaps a touch too much Parmesan. That's not really a complaint though... just finding something to quibble about.\n \nI had their prime rib special which looking back on it was a mistake. The prime rib was fine though not outstanding and it was reasonable at 35 dollars. It was also too much food in the end when combined with my other dishes. \n\nThe others in my party had salmon (i didn't get the verdict), the new york strip (judged good and the shallots very good), the crab cakes (judged outstanding), the salmon salad (good), as well as the french and soup du jour (a apple and parsnip soup). \n\nFor dessert two of us had chocolate mousse. The mousse was exactly what you'd hope and expect. They topped it with dark chocolate crunchy things which are good, but unfortunately just put pink berry in mind for me because they have to be exactly the same thing. Another person had the peach parfait and was a fan of it. \n\n---\nSo I'd give this 4 stars. The food was very good, but not truly exceptional, which I think it needs to be at this price range to earn a 5. The service was very good, refills on water came swiftly, and the pacing was appropriate for a French restaurant (i.e. slow, but purposefully and not annoyingly so). \n\nOf course, mention has to be made about the atmosphere. It's really nice. I asked for a table with a view of the Belaggio fountain, and they made us wait about 15 minutes upon arriving, but they gave us a good table for it. It was very pleasant. \n\nI'd definitely suggest this restaurant. I think you could probably get a better meal if you stepped up a price category somewhat, but then you wouldn't have the nice sidewalk cafe feel.",

For $89 on a Saturday night stay however, when the larger hotels on the strip were averaging $400 a night, it was a pretty good deal. It's located right next door to a cheesy las Vegas style wedding chapel (it actually shares the parking lot) and this actually adds a sort of interesting ambience to the experience. \n\nThe room was nothing fancy, but clean and the bathroom had been recently renovated. Tv and Internet both worked well. Front desk staff were friendly.\n\nThe major negative of this hotel is the location. It's not on the strip, but it's only about halfway down to the downtown core, so there are vacant areas of land a few blocks in either direction and it was a bit creepy walking through there at night. I'd recommend against walking, and instead take the double decker busses that conveniently stop nearby.\n\nAll in all, this is an ok place to stay if you're on a budget and don't mind the extra hassles in getting to the strip.",

Here they don't offer that. \n\nI ordered: \n\nPad Thai: I wish you could of seen my eyes when they gave it to me! It was so small. It was literally 1/3 of the portion from chada Thai. \n\nTom yum $10: I had to ask for no coconut milk for this since they only had tom yum kai. It's the same as Chada Thai and I think their tom yum is always great. Perfectly sour and spicy(ask for hot if you like spicy) \n\nSpicy chicken wings$7: it comes with only 5 but they were surprisingly good! It's a dry rub and has a little sour kick to them. \n\nCrispy pork belly $6: wish it was a little more crispy! I also had to sprinkle some salt to give it some flavor. \n\nCrab fat fried rice $12: very good! It had a great seafood crab taste. It could of used a little bit more crab meat. \n\nThe service was very attentive.

Just want I would expect from a nice Italian restaurant.\n\nBut we went for Mother's day.  And they had a special Menu.  What was special about it?  The prices were higher.  \n\nChicken Parmesan: Regularly $19.00 but today it was $22.00\nHouse Salad: Regularly $7.00 but today it was $9.00.\nBruschetta: Regularly $7.00 but today it was $9.00.\n\nMore than 15% increase.  For the exact same food.  I can't tell you what a bad taste this has left in my mouth.   I was here with my wife and toddler son.  So I'm not going to make a scene.  Had it been just me.  I would have walked out.  And I'm not going to take it out of the tip.  It's not the server's fault.  Ultimately this cost me about $7.00.  But It has cost Oggi my business.  There are other decent Italian restaurants in the Charlotte area and I will likely try every one of them before I ever go back.\n\nWhat a shame.",

The last time I had my hair relaxed I felt something was not right. My scalp felt tight and hair super flat. After a  day I realized my roots were at a 90 degree angle and that she had given me permanent hair bends. I had a trip to Europe for a month and when I got back went immediately to the salon. The owner took no blame and even told me it was probably due to the water in Europe. After doing my own research I knew it was because she applied the chemical at the root and not an inch away from the scalp. So now a few months later my roots have grown out two inches and are breaking off at the end causing thinning and coarse looking hair. My hair will be ruined for the next two years (until it grows out) since there is no way to reverse this damage. Not only did the owner ruin my hair but she also took no blame nor did she give me my money back. She gave me a free deep conditioner then convinced me to get a hair cut and buy $30 worth of hair products saying it would help tremendously (I was desperate). If you want quality hair care I suggest going elsewhere.",

    "text": "Mysterious underground entrances, adorned with just a guy in black and a red light, are universal urban code for \"THERE'S A SPEAKEASY HERE, DUMMY\".\n\nI took the plunge and checked it out. As expected, it was dark. Gloomy, almost. There were lots of tables, but I sat at the bar and started getting my gin on with an Aviation. I will say now they've got very talented and speedy mixologists, and this is perhaps in part due to a very limited repertoire. \n\nThe Ostrich lists fewer than two dozen craft cocktails. Half of these are classics, which are essential. Some of this menu changes with the seasons. Among these 8 options are the Corpse Reviver, which while a favorite of mine has been absolutely done to death, and should probably be a mainstay as opposed to taking up one of very few slots in a rotation. Another borrows from another local craft cocktail bar. You'll also find a more premium, \"barrel aged\" section of bourbon-based beverages. Altogether, it's a bit too heavy on one spirit, but still intriguing.\n\nAlas, I can boldly say that's still woefully brief compared to quite a few others. Simplicity itself is not a death sentence, however, so let's move on to the atmosphere. \n\nThis bar gets its name from having been \"an ostrich feather storage facility after World War I\". They believe an old-timey theme is reinforced by an emphasis on the same classics everyone else has, but I will say it is somewhat bereft of character altogether. I love dark basements, but it's just that--a basement. Decorations are sparse, music is a predictable generic indie station from 2011. I see no coherent theme or draw of this locale. At the very least, I want to feel like a classy bitch when I'm splurging, not like I'm at any old dive bar that happens to be underground. \n\nNevertheless, The Ostrich is a welcome addition to a downtown scene that has perhaps been underrated in the nightlife category. Those new to the cocktail scene will most definitely be inspired by its accessibility. Even though I don't see how it can pull in those willing to make a bit of a trek from other areas, or even the more seasoned, snobby drinkers, it is still alright with me, and I'd come back upon revisiting the area.",

    "text": "I have been a huge fan of this restaurant for several years, but after our most recent two trips there, I'm starting to think it's lost it's appeal. We were there on a Saturday night last summer and surprisingly it was not crowded. However, the service was terrible- the waitress never brought the cheese curds we ordered (we'd ordered them right away with our drinks) and then went on break after taking our order, so another server brought our entrees. I had the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing, which I have had before and really enjoyed, however this time it was terrible. The chicken was extremely dry and overcooked- inedible actually. When we finally flagged down another server to ask where our curds were, they insisted they'd already gone out to our table (um...no they didn't) and then finally brought us some, but at that point it was the end of the meal and we didn't want them anymore. I thought it was poor form that they didn't at least offer to take them off our bill. \n\nWe made another trip there today for lunch, and once again had mediocre service and food. We got stuck sitting in the main dining room, so we were freezing because of the draft from the door being constantly opened (always a problem there). As usual, the tables are really close together, so we were uncomfortably close to a couple next to us and could hear their entire conversation. Very awkward- especially since they appeared to be on a first or second date! And the worst part of the whole meal, was that THE CHEESE CURDS HAVE CHANGED! The curds were the best part of the whole restaurant! Today when they arrived they had a distinctly orange look- like the batter is totally different- and they were disgustingly greasy and heavy. We didn't even finish ours. Soooo disappointing!!! \n\nI think it might be time for me to start looking for a new favorite restaurant :(",

Came here to celebrate my sister's birthday and I had high hopes for this place and Herringbone did not disappoint. We did the brunch buffet. Our waitress, Jenna, was absolutely superb! She was so nice and made sure everything was to our liking. She went above and beyond and brought sissy a dessert for her birthday and even gave us a rose. 3 freaking roses. Who does that?! I've gone to some of the top restaraunts in Vegas for multiple occasions and just for fun and I've never had the experience that Jenna gave us.  There were cute stations all over the restaraunt, cold statio.-shrimp (cooked to perfection, I could have eaten a lot more shrimp but refrained cause I wanted dessert), poke (didn't try since I'm preggers but my table said it was the best) and crab legs open faced. I love how they have cocktail sauce and you can control the heat with the side of horseradish. I do wish there were little cups to hold the sauce on the side though, I don't like things to mix. Beverage station included in price and of course you can upgrade your package to have more alcohol and bottomless alcohol as well. Salad station was good, I really enjoyed their caesar. The hot station had lamb, pork and something else. But I pretty devoured the baked salmon. Omg, it was so creamy and not over cooked. The guys behind the hot station were so nice and made a delish shrimp omelette. You can also order from the kitchen. Fish tacos were good. Loco moco was good except my meat patty was dry, slightly disappointed in that.... but I will be coming back to get more from the kitchen and will let you know how it is! The staff was so great, our plates were always picked up, water always full, and I just loved it here. I will have to come back when it's cooler to sit outside.

They responded immediately to our questions, no matter the day or time. While we never met in person as we did the closing by proxy, we feel like we've known the Pinnacle team for years. We would recommend Pinnacle wholeheartedly!",

Ordered the mango pop ice, and honey crisp iced cream and dragon breath Cheetos all topped off with liquid nitrogen! \n\nMango pop ice lacked a little bit of flavour, but the mango syrup tasted really good with the iced cream. Light like dip and dots but I enjoyed it. \n\nThe honey crisp iced cream is definitely my favourite order. Unique. Sweet, crispy and creamy all in one!!! Would definitely order this again when I come back. \n\nLastly the dragons breathe with Cheetos. This is what you order if you wanna play around with the liquid nitrogen. Get this! It's super fun and adds to your experience. \n*TIP- chew a lot with your mouth closed. It produces the smokey liquid nitrogen and you can blow it through your nose or your mouth! \n\nVerdict - Come here for the experience. 4 stars for unique ice cream flavours and use of liquid nitrogen fun! Coming back in the future if I'm in the area.",

Stayed in a Terrace Studio recently and I loved the room.  The room was spacious, there was a living room area with a couch, bar/kitchen area with a microwave, dishwasher, sink, large shower, separate bath tub.  The room also had a balcony which I absolutely loved.  This stay, our room had a view of the Vegas Strip and faced Planet Hollywood directly.  Below, was a view of the Boulevard Pool.  Monday nights in the summer, the Cosmopolitan has Dive In movies.  We didn't have to go down to the Boulevard Pool to watch though since we could catch everything from the balcony of our room--pretty cool. \n\nThe Bamboo Pool and Boulevard Pool was really relaxing during the day.  I enjoyed the food that we ordered at the pool, I had a Chicken Pita Sandwich and the edamame, both were delicious. The pool area was calming and relatively quiet unless of course you go to Marquee Dayclub.  The Boulevard Pool area has foosball tables, pool tables and better music as opposed to the Bamboo Pool.  I guess it's probably why the Boulevard Pool boasted a younger and more hip crowd. \n\nService was amazing at the Cosmo, everyone I encountered was really friendly and helpful.  I love everything about the Cosmopolitan EXCEPT for the gambling.  I never seem to have had much luck here, but maybe I'll try again the next trip!",

It was kinda confused to me to get to this place, especially when you travel from the freeway. \n\nHowever, the dining experience that I had was pleasant. I didn't know Tuesday night is the wing night for 49c/wing with beverages, so it was just my day. I ordered 5 traditional Honey Hot, 5 traditional Asian Garlic, while my friend got the dry dip options for Lemon Pepper and Cheese.\n\nI have to say the Honey Hot flavor was splendid, and the wings came out hot, crispy, and fast. But, celery portion was too small and it was still not a lot when I asked for extra. DON\"T get the Lemon Pepper, it was very salty and didn't taste that good as recommended. \n\nOverall, I think I just found my new favorite spot for Tuesday nights.",

My favorite was the sniper rifle (SCAR-H), and my overall target result wasn't bad at all:)\n\nThe day we went was unexpectedly crowded, so we waited for like 2 hours.

It would be way more fun. Other than that I'm glad to get to try some cool guns here, great selections!",

We had the breakfast burrito, the shrimp and chips and the ah-maz-ing Churro Ice Cream Sandwich. The french fries were spectacular and seasoned with a variety of spices and just a hint of lemon juice. I would have never thought of putting lemon juice on french fries, but I loved it! But the standout was definitely the churro ice cream sandwich. Crunchy, cinnamon-y and lightly fried halves were filled with a homemade vanilla bean ice cream that gave just the right amount of sweetness. A total mess to eat, but worth every napkin. Would definitely stop back whenever in town.",

Nope...plenty of other things I could have been doing.  I went 3 times because there was nothing else I would rather have been doing in Vegas!!!  I only said Saturday was the best night because the crowd was the most enthusiastic that night.  It's funny to see people start out in the audience so serene, sitting in their seats, listening to My Generation and Hotel California, and then to be drawn to their feet and throw their grown-up restraint aside and bang their heads as if they still have their 80's big hair flowing.  If you think you have self-control, then I dare you to go to this show.  These guys will will you out of your seat and you'll be banging your head and wishing you had a lighter in the first 15 minutes. This isn't some cover band.

I also opted on getting a soup because I was starving. I ordered the thai ginger soup and it was deliciously creamy. I will definitely be back!

    "text": "HORRIBLE business people.  We purchased a curved light bar from 50 Caliber Racing at the OC Sand Sport show.  It was supposed to be a 40\" light bar (maximum length to fit inside the roll cage of our Maverick.  Got home & it was WAY too long (measured 52\").  I emailed them immediately explaining that we wanted to EXCHANGE the light bar we got for the correct size. I was told this was fine and to send them my contact info for a return label, which I did that same day.  Waited a few days, never received an email with a return label, so I contacted them by phone.  I was put on hold and Richie (the owner) picked up the line.  He immediately started bad-mouthing his employees, telling me how he has to take care of my issue since no one there knows what they're doing.  I tried explaining my situation, which quickly escalated for absolutely no reason.  Richie started arguing with me that the light bar we were sold would work, but he would need to make new brackets for us.  I kept trying to tell him that we want our light bar to fit inside the cage, and it has to be a 40\", no bigger.  We want to send him back the 52\" and have him send us back a 40\".  Out of nowhere, he started YELLING at me, saying how I wouldn't listen to him, then he HUNG UP ON ME.  He sent me the most ridiculous email saying I was a bully, when in reality, it was him who was being rude, unprofessional and would not listen to anything I was trying to tell him (not a way to win over customers, Richie).  Fast forward a couple weeks, I received another email asking if I wanted them to ship me a set of new brackets for the light bar I have (which again....IS WAY TOO LONG for our side by side).  WE WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!!!!!\nYes Richie...I am sticking to what I told you and letting everyone know about how you treat your customers.  I feel bad for your employees answering the phone who were nothing but polite & professional.  YOU and your ATTITUDE are the problem there.",

The place was relatively deserted on a Saturday afternoon and we were soon greeted by a woman who asked us what kind of naan we wanted (onion or plain).  The food tasted fairly good but what really turned us off was the woman who worked there and her constant coughing, hacking and wheezing without even covering her mouth!  Clearly she had a nasty cold and should've stayed home that day!  I cringed every time she went back into the kitchen (we could here her back there hacking up a lung) or came over to our table.  It was so unappetizing that we hardly ate anything and got out of there as soon as possible.  I don't think I can go back there given their low standard of hygiene.  Ick, I'm cringing right now thinking of it.  On the plus side though, it did keep me from overeating.  Maybe I should have my husband cough and hack at me whenever we go to buffets from now on!\n\nAnyway, I hate to trash a restaurant but I had to voice my concerns.  I am very conflicted about giving the second star, but the food itself wasn't bad.  Try at your own risk!",

The french onion soup had lots of onion flavor and some salt too.  The french dip was piled too high with meat in a sandwich roll which was not meant for dipping.  Its supposed to be dipped so either provide a big boat to be able to dip it our provide a sandwich size that fits the dipping bowl.  Fries were a bit soggy.

We were told that they no longer serve the special.  It is still on the website, however.  We again ordered the Sampler plate, but we did not get a sausage.  Again, the meat was not hot, no even warm and the cole slaw was not cold.  Have not decided if we will try this place again. Two ad out is probably our limit. I worry about the low temp of the meat and where it was setting -- not on a warmer or in a refrigerator.  I still prefer Memphis Championship BBQ on Warm Springs.

    "text": "We were after a bit of lighter dinner after nearly two weeks of eating out on vacation, and were already at the Bellagio while waiting for the doors to open for O.  A quick scan of the restaurant offerings seemed to suggest that Noodles would hit the spot.\n\nWe ordered a pair of specialty cocktails, the steamed dumplings, the Szechuan Dan-Dan noodle soup and the Spicy Thai Shrimp Noodle Soup.  I had high hopes, given the decor of the restaurant and the emphasis on \"Authentic regional dishes from all over Asia\".  \n\nFood snob warning:  I have fond memories of Dan-Dan Noodle Soup from visiting Szechuan province, and there's a restaurant near my home that does a pretty accurate version.  I also make it pretty well myself.  It's not hard.\n\nWhat I was served at Noodles compares only in name - the flavor of the broth was extremely muted and there was no measurable amount of heat to the dish.  It needed chili oil, and I tried to get some Szechuan chili oil from our server so I could fix it, but no can do - she said the kitchen doesn't have it.  Which seems odd, being that Szechuan chili oil is a key ingredient in this dish.\n\nI'd liken it to serving pho without having Sriracha and hoisin sauce to dip the meat in.  It's edible, but would be missing an expected set of flavors.\n\nAfter a little prodding, our server did bring out a dish of the house chili oil, which was chopped green/red jalapenos and garlic in vegetable oil.  It helped a little, but it doesn't exactly replace the complex flavors or the numbing sensation of Szechuan peppercorns.\n\nThe wife's Spicy Thai shrimp noodle soup was similarly bland and would have benefited from some additional fish sauce and Thai chili pepper.  She wasn't very happy either, but she doesn't feel a need to go off on a tirade about it.  That's my turf.\n\nAuthentic?  Not one bit.\nPalatable to the average American?  Sure.\n\nI did get to pay more than 50 times what a bowl of Dan-Dan noodle soup costs on the streets of Chengdu, and almost twice what it costs at home. So it had that going for it at least.  ;)\n\nI should have pulled the car from valet and driven to Chubby Cattle instead.  Oh well.",

And since customer service is one of major nits with these people, for me, the ball is in their court, which they have failed to return:\n\n\"I am very concerned about your experience with our company Chris! I apologize for the inconvenience you had with your upgrade as well as the service! Allow me the opportunity to restore your confidence in Verizon Wireless. You deserve the best customer service and I am here to give that to you! I would like to address your concerns with the dropped calls and provide you information about your upgrade. Please reply back with your full name and mobile number. I will contact you to better assist!\"\n\nI gave them my name and number last week, and have not heard back from them. And, I'm not going to go chasing a lame duck. And, now that I read that Verizon donates millions of our dollars to political special interests (which don't have OUR best interests at heart), it just keeps nailing the coffin shut for me. Yes, other big name mobile communications companies use their huge profits for political influence, but almost everything about the way Verizon does business, and fails in its service approach puts them at the bottom of the list behind AT&T , T-Mobile, etc. These companies are dominating our lives because they know, or figure upon the fact that we can't do without our mobile devices. But, what if we all took that power back, and formed a union, and jumped ship en masse? We would bring them to their knees. Who's with me?\n\nAnd hey, Verizon, how about no more mandatory software \"upgrades\" that actually slow my phone down and mess it up, with lost settings, that simply pisses me off! And, when will my phone ring when the ringer is turned on? Should I ask for a rebate check for the myriad of lost and deferred calls--some which have cost me a potential client? And, are you going to make good on your promise of a free upgrade to iPhone4S, or was that all golden carrot-dangling mularkey?\n\nUpdate: 8/19 -The customer service rep who responded below, just like the last person, asked for my info to get right back to me with, and of course, never did. Or, maybe she tried, and the phone never rang, being Verizon. I think I am going to sue Verizon for all my money back + damages. $97 x 20 months = $1,940.

I love the layout of this buffet with all the side dining areas, I mentioned to my husband that there were a lot of people here but it was so quiet. They have it spaced out that it really reduces the noise level and you don't have to yell at the person sitting across from you.\n\nThe place was clean, we didn't see anything on the ground or food on the counters. The employees were making sure the food didn't sit, they were walking around stirring and changing out spoons. Usually when I go to a buffet I pick up a couple of plates that are still dirty and put them to the side, not once for either of us.\n\nOur only complaint was the gentleman at the meat counter, my husband said 4 times pork sausage and the guy repeated it and then cut him a piece of turkey and was trying to hand it to him. I ended up taking, I wanted it anyways but he got an attitude when my husband told him, \"No thank you, I had asked for the pork sausage.\" Then when I came back to get another piece of turkey he was standing chit chatting with a woman and he watched me walk up and he stayed there for about 45 seconds to finish his conversation. He never greeted me and said he would be right over, just stared at me when I walked up. Very rude. Had he said he would be right over I wouldn't have taken a point away from them.\n\nOther than that, all of the food was cooked properly, everything was presentable, everything was clean, and for the most part the employees were all nice and greeted us.",

The one I got was pretty diluted. \n\nChocolate avalanche prob my favour. It was so good! I'm not a big fan of chocolate but this is by far the best chocolate pastry I've had. \n\nThe red velvet is cup cake is good. \n\nDef go back for the chocolate avalanche.

I wanted to eat here for dinner when I was in Vegas several months ago for my birthday, but the wait was over 2 hours.  And we had a show to catch, so ended up eating somewhere else at the time.\n\nThis time around, we came here during brunch-lunch hour.  The wait wasn't too bad at that time-like 20 minutes?  There's 2 lines: one line is for paying to get into the buffet, the second line is to get a table.  We were debating getting the Groupon, where you get the VIP breakfast experience for two, but decided not to get it.\n\nThey have so many different varieties of food.  I tried a little bit of everything: dim sum, prime rib, roasted duck, clams, sushi, creme brulee, flan, etc.  My favorite was the prime rib and there was this speciality dish of pork belly on top of squash and another similar one with short rib on top of mashed potatoes.  They also have fresh fruit juices-my favorite was the guava juice.  Their dessert selection was so good also! So many varieties!  \n\nOverall, its a great place to eat.  I would come back to eat here again, but during dinnertime.",

I have lived here for 8 years and this is serioulsy one of the best pizzas I have found in the valley. If I remember correctly they make their own sausage. The crust is fantastic, hand made, a nice crispness, even the smell alone screams quality. We have also had the bread knots and the toasted/fried ravioli. I havent seen toasted ravioli on a menu since I have moved here. Everything has been delicious.  We are looking forward to exploring other aspects of the menu, including some things we are not familiar with, but must be more popular on the east coast, including rice balls, and Jamaican beef patties. They also sell various sauces, olives, homemade sausage n' cookies, and other Italian goodies for the kitchen. Pizzalicious!",

JOEY's weakest point would be our first interaction with their staff here. Otherwise our experience continued quite positively.\n\nOrdered some drinks and beers that were on special -- all arrived rather quickly. \n\nShared the yam fries and artichoke dip to start; both were quite delicious and we polished off the crumbs off the plates. \n\nI ordered the 12oz. New York -- cooked to perfection and accompanied by delicious sides. If you're hungry and a meat eater, you'll love this.

I really enjoyed this dish, the steak was cooked well and enjoyed the crispy frites.\nEscargot - it was a treat to enjoy these piping hot snail appetizers. Cooked in butter and fresh herbs.\nFrench onion soup - one of the best French onion soups that I have had. A savory flavor with sweet onions, bread and melted cheese.\nChicken liver mousse pate - this dish is my favorite. creamy texture and delicious flavor. Served with tasty burgundy red wine mustard and cornichons, which add a nice sweet and sour touch to the pate. Comes with delicious crispy bread slices, also goes great with complimentary baguette and butter.\nSangria - cool, sweet and refreshing. Perfect to enjoy while dining out on the patio on a warm and sunny day. \n\nThe service is professional and prompt. They checked in with us regularly to make sure we are doing ok and asked if we have additional requests.\n\nThe restaurant is spacious and it gets very busy during lunch and dinner time.

    "text": "Jacques Brel is alive and living in Cleveland, in 5 magnificent restored theatres that are the pride of a city that nearly lost its soul but somehow found the means to grab it back.\r\n\r\nCleveland boasts the 2nd largest theatre district in the United States, after New York's Broadway district.   Can you believe that?  The rescue and restoration of Playhouse Square, a collection of 5 classic and opulent old theatre properties on Cleveland's near east side of downtown is perhaps the most significant and certainly among the proudest moments in Cleveland's post World War II history.  \r\n\r\nThe State, Palace, Ohio, Allen, and Hanna theatres, clustered around this end of downtown a few blocks east of Public Square, opened in the early 1920's, and saw a heydey through World War II.  But all 5 had fallen into disrepair and disrepute just a couple of decades after the end of the war as Cleveland's residents fled downtown altogether for suburban living.   \r\n\r\nThe magnificent theatres were threatened with demolition for bland commercial projects or surface parking lots, but when it seemed their days were numbered, civic groups struggled to save them and finally won control of 2 of the theatres.  They restored the facades and lobbies and then worked on the grand theatre spaces.  A landmark moment came when the play Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris opened in the lobby of the State for a limited run that eventually lasted 2 years.  \r\n\r\nJacques Brel helped feed momentum and over the course of a decade Playhouse Square Center was formed, money was raised, two more theatres were purchased, and a 40 million dollar renovation project finally restored these theatres to their former glory. The Hanna soon joined the group, and Playhouse Square resumed its rightful role as the cultural centerpiece in a glittering Cleveland crown that already boasts the best orchestra in the United States, a magnificent art museum in a grand collection of museums, and one of the oldest African-American cultural centers (Karamu House).\r\n\r\nIf I have one quibble it's that there is not much local theatre originating here, but the 5 theatres in Playhouse Square's program host hundreds of events every year and play a major role in keeping Cleveland's wonderful heart still beating.",

The interior was simple but elegant, and they pay a lot of attention to details (there were designated glass place holders on each table!!). \n\nNote worthy moment: We asked one of the staff to take a picture of us, as we were celebrating a b'day and he did. But he went a step further by asking if it's ok if he took a picture from outside the restaurant of both of us since we were seated by the window. Now that's customer service - Going over and beyond to satisfy customers!!! Two thumbs up! :)\n\nWith regards to food I'm going to give Pattaya 5 full stars! It's up to par with the Thai holy grails downtown. The squash fritters were so crispy and fresh with a delicious sauce, and the presentation was beautiful. For mains we ordered Holy Basil Chicken and Curry Pad Thai w/ Chicken and they were both perfection! I really wanted their Mango Sticky rice for dessert but we were stuffed by then. But I shall be back, so no worries! :)\n\nAll in all, Pattaya is definitely worth the trek to the East end if you're not from this end of the town. It is rather small for a restaurant, but they have optimized the space to seat as many as possible comfortably. Do give it a try!!",

Traditionally, pork hash (a type of potsticker) are usually in small bit s size pieces- but these are huge in portions. If your ever having a Hawaiian potluck, this would be my recommendation!\n\nI'm excited to try other dishes on the menu.\n\nIt's not a big menu with tons of selections, I like that they are keeping it simple without so much confusion.\n\nPoke, cone sushi, long johns, Kalbi, teri beef, & island style chicken is also available.\n\nIf your in the area & craving some Hawaiian fare, I would recommend this place!\n\nI will be ordering from them again in the near future.

After much prodding from a dear friend of mine before I attempted my VBAC I decided I would reach out to Michelle at the very least for placenta encapsulation.  Michelle urged me to meet with her just to see if we would be a fit for doula/client services and I thank God she did.  Michelle helped not only myself, but really put my husband at ease for all the things that were going to come with having a VBAC birth.  You see, neither of us knew what to expect and Michelle really was there for every stage. Not having my mother living near me, Michelle became that mother figure I so needed during my birth. She was the encourager and the help to get me to refocus when I was getting a little too lion-ness with my voice (my husband will tell you I was LOUD lol).  I literally cannot imagine doing it without Michelle.\n\nOh, and then came after the birth! Placenta encapsulation...if you haven't done...have another baby because boy are you missing out--that stuff is like nectar from the Gods. Then the salves, the nursing help and even just the comfort she provided was amazing.\n\nThank you Michelle for all you do for us momma's. I'm so grateful for you and will definitely have you again!",

    "text": "Went to Dr. Hankins for a breast augmentation. My body went through quite a change; starting with a small B, going to an almost Double D while nursing my baby, to deflating to a Double A when all was said and done. I hated taking off my bra, I felt so uncomfortable in my skin. I didn't feel like me. I went in with the notion of not necessarily wanting them bigger so much as wanting them back. Dr. Hankins and Bambi were very informative about everything and suggested a size proportionate to my body. 6 months after my surgery, though the size did fit my body, they didn't fit my mind. I was more comfortable with a smaller size, even if it was smaller than proportions. Dr. Hankins suggested I wait a year to make sure it was really what I wanted. \nAfter a year and some change I went back to visit Dr. Hankins and we talked about my comfort levels with my breast size and what would be the best option. He suggested a size to me, explained to me the difference from the first implants to the next, and just a little under 3 weeks ago I had my second procedure with Dr. Hankins. I was awake for this procedure and as soon as I sat up on the table, I knew I would love them. I got many compliments on my first set, people commented on their feel and how they looked; and I get twice as many compliments on my new pair. Now it's not just about how real they feel or how they drop or how natural they look, but also on how they fit me as a person and my active lifestyle. \nSo happy I went with Dr. Hankins. I know girls will \"shop around\" and that is a great idea, get as much info as you can, but I will wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Hankins any day.",

There was a red head girl in black pants, a white shirt (not blouse) with the sleeves cut off and hemmed so yea, a professional wife beater shirt I guess and thin strap sandals.  Not professional business attire at all! The girl in the black dress had cute trendy platform shoes on, however the dress was too short to be business professional. She looked like she should be working at Francesca's. The girl with the gray dress on looked fine and was in business attire.  However, she was your hostess, not a sales person. I'm not saying that you're not capable of running a great store, but it all starts with first impressions.  Get your team to dress better. These brides are looking for their fairy tale to come true and be treated like a princess, not shopping for their summer attire at Tillys. It's a special day for brides from engagement to the end of their wedding day. Im glad you're a small business, that's why we visited your store. It just wasn't the best one we visited. However, you have potential. You have a great location, in a nice area.  Best of luck to you.",
